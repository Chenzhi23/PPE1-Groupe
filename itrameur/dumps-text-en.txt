On March 30, 2022, the White House issued a proclamation recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility, the first time a U.S. president has done so. More recently, singer and actor Janelle MonÃ¡e came out as nonbinary, while the U.S. State Department and Social Security Administration announced that Americans will be allowed to select â€œXâ€ rather than â€œmaleâ€ or â€œfemaleâ€ for their sex marker on their passport and Social Security applications. At the same time, several states have enacted or are considering legislation that would limit the rights of transgender and nonbinary people. These include bills requiring people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth, prohibiting trans athletes from competing on teams that match their gender identity, and restricting the availability of health care to trans youth seeking to medically transition. A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 1.6% of U.S. adults are transgender or nonbinary â€“ that is, their gender is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. This includes people who describe themselves as a man, a woman or nonbinary, or who use terms such as gender fluid or agender to describe their gender. While relatively few U.S. adults are transgender, a growing share say they know someone who is (44% today vs. 37% in 2017). One-in-five say they know someone who doesnâ€™t identify as a man or woman. In order to better understand the experiences of transgender and nonbinary adults at a time when gender identity is at the center of many national debates, Pew Research Center conducted a series of focus groups with trans men, trans women and nonbinary adults on issues ranging from their gender journey, to how they navigate issues of gender in their day-to-day life, to what they see as the most pressing policy issues facing people who are trans or nonbinary. This is part of a larger study that includes a survey of the general public on their attitudes about gender identity and issues related to people who are transgender or nonbinary. Terminology (BUTTON) The terms transgender and trans are used interchangeably throughout this essay to refer to people whose gender is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. This includes, but is not limited to, transgender men (that is, men who were assigned female at birth) and transgender women (women who were assigned male at birth). Nonbinary adults are defined here as those who are neither a man nor a woman or who arenâ€™t strictly one or the other. While some nonbinary focus group participants sometimes use different terms to describe themselves, such as â€œgender queer,â€ â€œgender fluidâ€ or â€œgenderless,â€ all said the term â€œnonbinaryâ€ describes their gender in the screening questionnaire. Some, but not all, nonbinary participants also consider themselves to be transgender. References to gender transitions relate to the process through which trans and nonbinary people express their gender as different from social expectations associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. This may include social, legal and medical transitions. The social aspect of a gender transition may include going by a new name or using different pronouns, or expressing their gender through their dress, mannerisms, gender roles or other ways. The legal aspect may include legally changing their name or changing their sex or gender designation on legal documents or identification. Medical care may include treatments such as hormone therapy, laser hair removal and/or surgery. References to femme indicate feminine gender expression. This is often in contrast to â€œmasc,â€ meaning masculine gender expression. Cisgender is used to describe people whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth and who do not identify as transgender or nonbinary. Misgendering is defined as referring to or addressing a person in ways that do not align with their gender identity, including using incorrect pronouns, titles (such as â€œsirâ€ or â€œmaâ€™amâ€), and other terms (such as â€œsonâ€ or â€œdaughterâ€) that do not match their gender. References to dysphoria may include feelings of distress due to the mismatch of oneâ€™s gender and sex assigned at birth, as well as a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which is sometimes a prerequisite for access to health care and medical transitions. The acronym LGBTQ+ refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (or, in some cases, questioning), and other sexual orientations or gender identities that are not straight or cisgender, such as intersex, asexual or pansexual. How we did this (BUTTON) Pew Research Center conducted this research to better understand the experiences and views of transgender and nonbinary U.S. adults. Because transgender and nonbinary people make up only about 1.6% of the adult U.S. population, this is a difficult population to reach with a probability-based, nationally representative survey. As an alternative, we conducted a series of focus groups with trans and nonbinary adults covering a variety of topics related to the trans and nonbinary experience. This allows us to go more in-depth on some of these topics than a survey would typically allow, and to share these experiences in the participantsâ€™ own words. For this project, we conducted six online focus groups, with a total of 27 participants (four to five participants in each group), from March 8-10, 2022. Participants were recruited by targeted email outreach among a panel of adults who had previously said on a survey that they were transgender or nonbinary, as well as via connections through professional networks and LGBTQ+ organizations, followed by a screening call. Candidates were eligible if they met the technology requirements to participate in an online focus group and if they either said they consider themselves to be transgender or if they said their gender was nonbinary or another identity other than man or woman (regardless of whether or not they also said they were transgender). For more details, see the Methodology. Participants who qualified were placed in groups as follows: one group of nonbinary adults only (with a nonbinary moderator); one group of trans women only (with a trans woman moderator); one group of trans men only (with a trans man moderator); and three groups with a mix of trans and nonbinary adults (with either a nonbinary moderator or a trans man moderator). All of the moderators had extensive experience facilitating groups, including with transgender and nonbinary participants. The participants were a mix of ages, races/ethnicities, and were from all corners of the country. For a detailed breakdown of the participantsâ€™ demographic characteristics, see the Methodology. The findings are not statistically representative and cannot be extrapolated to wider populations. Some quotes have been lightly edited for clarity or to remove identifying details. In this essay, participants are identified as trans men, trans women, or nonbinary adults based on their answers to the screening questionnaire. These words donâ€™t necessarily encompass all of the ways in which participants described their gender. Participantsâ€™ ages are grouped into the following categories: late teens; early/mid/late 20s, 30s and 40s; and 50s and 60s (those ages 50 to 69 were grouped into bigger â€œbucketsâ€ to better preserve their anonymity). These focus groups were not designed to be representative of the entire population of trans and nonbinary U.S. adults, but the participantsâ€™ stories provide a glimpse into some of the experiences of people who are transgender and/or nonbinary. The groups included a total of 27 transgender and nonbinary adults from around the U.S. and ranging in age from late teens to mid-60s. Most currently live in an urban area, but about half said they grew up in a suburb. The groups included a mix of White, Black, Hispanic, Asian and multiracial American participants. See Methodology for more details. Identity and the gender journey (Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Most focus group participants said they knew from an early age â€“ many as young as preschool or elementary school â€“ that there was something different about them, even if they didnâ€™t have the words to describe what it was. Some described feeling like they didnâ€™t fit in with other children of their sex but didnâ€™t know exactly why. Others said they felt like they were in the wrong body. â€œI remember preschool, [where] the boys were playing on one side and the girls were playing on the other, and I just had a moment where I realized what side I was supposed to be on and what side people thought I was supposed to be on. â€¦ Yeah, I always knew that I was male, since my earliest memories.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s â€œAs a small child, like around kindergarten [or] first grade â€¦ I just was [fascinated] by how some people were small girls, and some people were small boys, and it was on my mind constantly. And I started to feel very uncomfortable, just existing as a young girl.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 30s â€œI was 9 and I was at day camp and I was changing with all the other 9-year-old girls â€¦ and I remember looking at everybodyâ€™s body around me and at my own body, and even though I was visually seeing the exact shapeless nine-year-old form, I literally thought to myself, â€˜oh, maybe I was supposed to be a boy,â€™ even though I know I wasnâ€™t seeing anything different. â€¦ And I remember being so unbothered by the thought, like not a panic, not like, â€˜oh man, Iâ€™m so different, like everybody here Iâ€™m so different and this is terrible,â€™ I was like, â€˜oh, maybe I was supposed to be a boy,â€™ and for some reason that exact quote really stuck in my memory.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 30s â€œSince I was little, I felt as though I was a man who, when they were passing out bodies, someone made a goof and I got a female body instead of the male body that I should have had. But I was forced by society, especially at that time growing up, to just make my peace with having a female body.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 50s â€œIâ€™ve known ever since I was little. Iâ€™m not really sure the age, but I just always knew when I put on boy clothes, I just felt so uncomfortable.â€ â€“ Trans woman, late 30s â€œIt was probably as early as I can remember that I wasnâ€™t like my brother or my father [and] not exactly like my girl cousins but I was something else, but I didnâ€™t know what it was.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 60s Many participants were well into adulthood before they found the words to describe their gender. For those focus group participants, the path to self-discovery varied. Some described meeting someone who was transgender and relating to their experience; others described learning about people who are trans or nonbinary in college classes or by doing their own research. â€œI read a Time magazine article â€¦ called â€˜Homosexuality in Americaâ€™ â€¦ in 1969. â€¦ Of course, we didnâ€™t have language like we do now or people were not willing to use it â€¦ [but] it was kind of the first word that I had ever heard that resonated with me at all. So, I went to school and I took the magazine, we were doing show-and-tell, and I stood up in front of the class and said, â€˜I am a homosexual.â€™ So that began my journey to figure this stuff out.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 60s â€œIt wasnâ€™t until maybe I was 20 or so when my friend started his transition where I was like, â€˜Wow, that sounds very similar to the emotions and challenges I am going through with my own identity.â€™ â€¦ My whole life from a very young age I was confused, but I didnâ€™t really put a name on it until I was about 20.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 20s â€œI knew about drag queens, but I didnâ€™t know what trans was until I got to college and was exposed to new things, and that was when I had a word for myself for the first time.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 40s â€œI thought that by figuring out that I was interested in women, identifying as lesbian, I thought [my anxiety and sadness] would dissipate in time, and that was me cracking the code. But then, when I got older, I left home for the first time. I started to meet other trans people in the world. Thatâ€™s when I started to become equipped with the vocabulary. The understanding that this is a concept, and this makes sense. And thatâ€™s when I started to understand that I wasnâ€™t cisgender.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 30s â€œWhen I took a human sexuality class in undergrad and I started learning about gender and different sexualities and things like that, I was like, â€˜oh my god. I feel seen.â€™ So, thatâ€™s where I learned about it for the first time and started understanding how I identify.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-20s Focus group participants used a wide range of words to describe how they see their gender. For many nonbinary participants, the term â€œnonbinaryâ€ is more of an umbrella term, but when it comes to how they describe themselves, they tend to use words like â€œgender queerâ€ or â€œgender fluid.â€ The word â€œqueerâ€ came up many times across different groups, often to describe anyone who is not straight or cisgender. Some trans men and women preferred just the terms â€œmanâ€ or â€œwoman,â€ while some identified strongly with the term â€œtransgender.â€ The graphic below shows just some of the words the participants used to describe their gender. The way nonbinary people conceptualize their gender varies. Some said they feel like theyâ€™re both a man and a woman â€“ and how much they feel like they are one or the other may change depending on the day or the circumstance. Others said they donâ€™t feel like they are either a man or a woman, or that they donâ€™t have a gender at all. Some, but not all, also identified with the term transgender. â€œI had days where I would go out and just play with the boys and be one of the boys, and then there would be times that I would play with the girls and be one of the girls. And then I just never really knew what I was. I just knew that I would go back and forth.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-20s â€œGrowing up with more of a masculine side or a feminine side, I just never was a fan of the labelling in terms of, â€˜oh, this is a bit too masculine, you donâ€™t wear jewelry, you donâ€™t wear makeup, oh youâ€™re not feminine enough.â€™ â€¦ I used to alternate just based on who I felt I was. So, on a certain day if I felt like wearing a dress, or a skirt versus on a different day, I felt like wearing what was considered menâ€™s pants. â€¦ So, for me itâ€™s always been both.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-30s â€œI feel like my gender is so amorphous and hard to hold and describe even. Itâ€™s been important to find words for it, to find the outlines of it, to see the shape of it, but itâ€™s not something that I think about as who I am, because Iâ€™m more than just that.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œWhat words would I use to describe me? Genderless, if gender wasnâ€™t a thing. â€¦ I guess if pronouns didnâ€™t exist and you just called me [by my name]. Thatâ€™s what my gender is. â€¦ And I do use nonbinary also, just because it feels easier, I guess.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 20s Some participants said their gender is one of the most important parts of their identity, while others described it as one of many important parts or a small piece of how they see themselves. For some, the focus on gender can get tiring. Those who said gender isnâ€™t a central â€“ or at least not the most central â€“ part of their identity mentioned race, ethnicity, religion and socioeconomic class as important aspects that shape their identity and experiences. â€œIt is tough because [gender] does affect every factor of your life. If you are doing medical transitioning then you have appointments, you have to pay for the appointments, you have to be working in a job that supports you to pay for those appointments. So, it is definitely integral, and it has a lot of branches. And it deals with how you act, how you relate to friends, you know, I am sure some of us can relate to having to come out multiple times in our lives. That is why sexuality and gender are very integral and I would definitely say I am proud of it. And I think being able to say that I am proud of it, and my gender, I guess is a very important part of my identity.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 20s â€œSometimes I get tired of thinking about my gender because I am actively [undergoing my medical transition]. So, it is a lot of things on my mind right now, constantly, and it sometimes gets very tiring. I just want to not have to think about it some days. So, I would say itâ€™s, itâ€™s probably in my top three [most important parts of my identity] â€“ parent, Black, queer nonbinary.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-40s â€œI live in a town with a large queer and trans population and I donâ€™t have to think about my gender most of the time other than having to come out as trans. But Iâ€™m poor and that colors everything. Itâ€™s not a chosen part of my identity but that part of my identity is a lot more influential than my gender.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 40s â€œMy gender is very important to my identity because I feel that they go hand in hand. Now my identity is also broken down into other factors [like] character, personality and other stuff that make up the recipe for my identity. But my gender plays a big part of it. â€¦ It is important because itâ€™s how I live my life every day. When I wake up in the morning, I do things as a woman.â€ â€“ Trans woman, mid-40s â€œI feel more strongly connected to my other identities outside of my gender, and I feel like parts of itâ€™s just a more universal thing, like thereâ€™s a lot more people in my socioeconomic class and we have much more shared experiences.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s Some participants spoke about how their gender interacted with other aspects of their identity, such as their race, culture and religion. For some, being transgender or nonbinary can be at odds with other parts of their identity or background. â€œCulturally Iâ€™m Dominican and Puerto Rican, a little bit of the macho machismo culture, in my family, and even now, if Iâ€™m going to be a man, Iâ€™ve got to be a certain type of man. So, I cannot just be who Iâ€™m meant to be or who I want myself to be, the human being that I am.â€ â€“ Trans man, mid-30s â€œ[Judaism] is a very binary religion. There is a lot of things like for men to do and a lot of things for women to do. â€¦ So, it is hard for me now as a gender queer person, right, to connect on some levels with [my] religion â€¦ I have just now been exposed to a bunch of trans Jewish spaces online which is amazing.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-40s â€œJust being Indian American, I identify and love aspects of my culture and ethnicity, and I find them amazing and I identify with that, but itâ€™s kind of separated. So, I identify with the culture, then I identify here in terms of gender and being who I am, but I kind of feel the necessity to separate the two, unfortunately.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-30s â€œI think itâ€™s really me being a Black woman or a Black man that can sometimes be difficult. And also, my ethnic background too. Itâ€™s really rough for me with my family back home and things of that nature.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-20s Navigating gender day-to-day (Getty Images) For some, deciding how open to be about their gender identity can be a constant calculation. Some participants reported that they choose whether or not to disclose that they are trans or nonbinary in a given situation based on how safe or comfortable they feel and whether itâ€™s necessary for other people to know. This also varies depending on whether the participant can easily pass as a cisgender man or woman (that is, they can blend in so that others assume them to be cisgender and donâ€™t recognize that they are trans or nonbinary). â€œIt just depends on whether I feel like I have the energy to bring it up, or if it feels worth it to me like with doctors and stuff like that. I always bring it up with my therapists, my primary [care doctor], I feel like she would get it. I guess it does vary on the situation and my capacity level.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 20s â€œI decide based on the person and based on the context, like if I feel comfortable enough to share that piece of myself with them, because I do have the privilege of being able to move through the world and be identified as cis[gender] if I want to. But then it is important to me â€“ if youâ€™re important to me, then you will know who I am and how I identify. Otherwise, if I donâ€™t feel comfortable or safe then I might not.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œThe expression of my gender doesnâ€™t vary. Who I let in to know that I was formerly female â€“ or formerly perceived as female â€“ is kind of on a need to know basis.â€ â€“ Trans man, 60s â€œItâ€™s important to me that people not see me as cis[gender], so I have to come out a lot when Iâ€™m around new people, and sometimes thatâ€™s challenging. â€¦ Itâ€™s not information that comes out in a normal conversation. You have to force it and thatâ€™s difficult sometimes.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 40s Work is one realm where many participants said they choose not to share that they are trans or nonbinary. In some cases, this is because they want to be recognized for their work rather than the fact that they are trans or nonbinary; in others, especially for nonbinary participants, they fear it will be perceived as unprofessional. â€œItâ€™s gotten a lot better recently, but I feel like when youâ€™re nonbinary and you use they/them pronouns, itâ€™s just seen as really unprofessional and has been for a lot of my life.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œWhether itâ€™s LinkedIn or profiles [that] have been updated, Iâ€™ve noticed peopleâ€™s resumes have their pronouns now. I donâ€™t go that far because I just feel like itâ€™s a professional environment, itâ€™s nobodyâ€™s business.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-30s â€œI donâ€™t necessarily volunteer the information just to make it public; I want to be recognized for my character, my skill set, in my work in other ways.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 30s Some focus group participants said they donâ€™t mind answering questions about what itâ€™s like to be trans or nonbinary but were wary of being seen as the token trans or nonbinary person in their workplace or among acquaintances. Whether or not they are comfortable answering these types of questions sometimes depends on whoâ€™s asking, why they want to know, and how personal the questions get. â€œIâ€™ve talked to [my cousin about being trans] a lot because she has a daughter, and her daughter wants to transition. So, she always will come to me asking questions.â€ â€“ Trans woman, early 40s â€œIt is tough being considered the only resource for these topics, right? In my job, I would hate to call myself the token nonbinary, but I was the first nonbinary person that they hired and they were like, â€˜Oh, my gosh, let me ask you all the questions as you are obviously the authority on the subject.â€™ And it is like, â€˜No, that is a part of me, but there are so many other great resources.â€™â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 20s â€œI donâ€™t want to be the token. Iâ€™m not going to be no spokesperson. If you have questions, Iâ€™m the first person you can ask. Absolutely. I donâ€™t mind discussing. Ask me some of the hardest questions, because if you ask somebody else you might get you know your clock cleaned. So, ask me now â€¦ so you can be educated properly. Otherwise, I donâ€™t believe itâ€™s anybodyâ€™s business.â€ â€“ Trans woman, early 40s Most nonbinary participants said they use â€œthey/themâ€ as their pronouns, but some prefer alternatives. These alternatives include a combination of gendered and gender-neutral pronouns (like she/they) or simply preferring that others use oneâ€™s names rather than pronouns. â€œIf I could, I would just say my name is my pronoun, which I do in some spaces, but it just is not like a larger view. It feels like Iâ€™d rather have less labor on me in that regard, so I just say they/them.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 20s â€œFor me personally, I donâ€™t get mad if someone calls me â€˜heâ€™ because I see what theyâ€™re looking at. They look and they see a guy. So, I donâ€™t get upset. I know a few people who do â€¦ and they correct you. Me, Iâ€™m a little more fluid. So, thatâ€™s how it works for me.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-30s â€œI use they/she pronouns and I put â€˜theyâ€™ first because that is what I think is most comfortable and itâ€™s what I want to draw peopleâ€™s attention to, because Iâ€™m 5 feet tall and 100 pounds so itâ€™s not like I scream masculine at first sight, so I like putting â€˜theyâ€™ first because otherwise people always default to â€˜she.â€™ But I have â€˜sheâ€™ in there, and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™d have â€˜sheâ€™ in there if I had not had kids.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 30s â€œWhy is it so hard for people to think of me as nonbinary? I choose not to use only they/them pronouns because I do sometimes identify with â€˜she.â€™ But Iâ€™m like, â€˜Do I need to use they/them pronouns to be respected as nonbinary?â€™ Sometimes I feel like I should do that. But I donâ€™t want to feel like I should do anything. I just want to be myself and have that be accepted and respected.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œI have a lot of patience for people, but [once someone in public used] they/them pronouns and I thanked them and they were like, â€˜Yeah, I just figure Iâ€™d do it when I donâ€™t know [someoneâ€™s] pronouns.â€™ And Iâ€™m like, â€˜I love it, thank you.â€™â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s Transgender and nonbinary participants find affirmation of their gender identity and support in various places. Many cited their friends, chosen families (and, less commonly, their relatives), therapists or other health care providers, religion, or LGBTQ+ spaces as sources of support. â€œIâ€™m just not close with my family [of origin], but I have a huge chosen family that I love and that fully respects my identity.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œBefore the pandemic I used to go out to bars a lot; thereâ€™s a queer bar in my town and it was a really nice place just being friends with everybody who went and everybody who worked there, it felt really nice you know, and just hearing everybody use the right pronouns for me it just felt really good.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œI donâ€™t necessarily go to a lot of dedicated support groups, but I found that thereâ€™s kind of a good amount of support in areas or groups or fandoms for things that have a large LGBT population within them. Like certain shows or video games, where itâ€™s just kind of a joke that all the gay people flock to this.â€ â€“ Trans woman, late teens â€œBeing able to practice my religion in a location with a congregation that is just completely chill about it, or so far has been completely chill about it, has been really amazing.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 30s Many participants shared specific moments they said were small in the grand scheme of things but made them feel accepted and affirmed. Examples included going on dates, gestures of acceptance by a friend or social group, or simply participating in everyday activities. â€œI went on a date with a really good-looking, handsome guy. And he didnâ€™t know that I was trans. But I told him, and we kept talking and hanging out. â€¦ Thatâ€™s not the first time that I felt affirmed or felt like somebody is treating me as I present myself. But â€¦ he made me feel wanted and beautiful.â€ â€“ Trans woman, late 30s â€œI play [on a menâ€™s rec league] hockey [team]. â€¦ I joined the league like right when I first transitioned and I showed up and I was â€¦ nervous with locker rooms and stuff, and they just accepted me as male right away.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s â€œI ended up going into a barbershop. â€¦ The barber was very welcoming, and talked to me as if I was just a casual customer and there was something that clicked within that moment where, figuring out my gender identity, I just wanted to exist in the world to do these natural things like other boys and men would do. So, there was just something exciting about that. It wasnâ€™t a super macho masculine moment, â€¦ he just made me feel like I blended in.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 30s Participants also talked about negative experiences, such as being misgendered, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, some shared instances where they were treated or addressed as a gender other than the gender that they identify as, such as people referring to them as â€œheâ€ when they go by â€œshe,â€ or where they were deadnamed, meaning they were called by the name they had before they transitioned. â€œI get misgendered on the phone a lot and thatâ€™s really annoying. And then, even after I correct them, they keep doing it, sometimes on purpose and sometimes I think theyâ€™re just reading a script or something.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s â€œThe times that I have been out, presenting femme, there is this very subconscious misgendering that people do and it can be very frustrating. [Once, at a restaurant,] I was dressed in makeup and nails and shoes and everything and still everyone was like, â€˜Sir, what would you like?â€™ â€¦ Those little things â€“ those microaggressions â€“ they can really eat away at people.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-40s â€œPeople not calling me by the right name. My family is a big problem, they just wonâ€™t call me by my name, you know? Except for my nephew, who is of the Millennial generation, so at least he gets it.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 60s â€œIâ€™m constantly misgendered when I go out places. I accept this â€“ because of the way I look, people are going to perceive me as a woman and it doesnâ€™t cause me huge dysphoria or anything, itâ€™s just nice that the company that I keep does use the right pronouns.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s Some participants also shared stories of discrimination, bias, humiliation, and even violence. These experiences ranged from employment discrimination to being outed (that is, someone else disclosing the fact that they are transgender or nonbinary without their permission) without their permission to physical attacks. â€œI was on a date with this girl and I had to use the bathroom â€¦ and the janitor â€¦ wouldnâ€™t let me use the menâ€™s room, and he kept refusing to let me use the menâ€™s room, so essentially, I ended up having to use the same bathroom as my date.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s â€œIâ€™ve been denied employment due to my gender identity. I walked into a supermarket looking for jobs. â€¦ And they flat out didnâ€™t let me apply. They didnâ€™t even let me apply.â€ â€“ Trans man, mid-30s â€œ[In high school,] this group of guys said, â€˜[name] is gay.â€™ I ignored them but they literally threw me and tore my shirt from my back and pushed me to the ground and tried to strip me naked. And I had to fight for myself and use my bag to hit him in the face.â€ â€“ Trans woman, late 20s â€œI took a college course [after] I had my name changed legally and the instructor called me out in front of the class and called me a liar and outed me.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s Seeking medical care for gender transitions (Getty Images) Many, but not all, participants said they have received medical care, such as surgery or hormone therapy, as part of their gender transition. For those who havenâ€™t undergone a medical transition, the reasons ranged from financial barriers to being nervous about medical procedures in general to simply not feeling that it was the right thing for them. â€œFor me to really to live my truth and live my identity, I had to have the surgery, which is why I went through it. It doesnâ€™t mean [that others] have to, or that it will make you more or less of a woman because you have it. But for me to be comfortable, â€¦ that was a big part of it. And so, thatâ€™s why I felt I had to get it.â€ â€“ Trans woman, early 40s â€œIâ€™m older and itâ€™s an operation. â€¦ Iâ€™m just kind of scared, I guess. Iâ€™ve never had an operation. I mean, like any kind of operation. Iâ€™ve never been to the hospital or anything like that. So, it [is] just kind of scary. But I mean, I want to. I think about all the time. I guess have got to get the courage up to do it.â€ â€“ Trans woman, early 40s â€œIâ€™ve decided that the dysphoria of a second puberty â€¦ would just be too much for me and Iâ€™m gender fluid enough where Iâ€™m happy, I guess.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œIâ€™m too old to change anything, I mean I am what I am. [laughs]â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 60s Many focus group participants who have sought medical treatment for their gender transition faced barriers, although some had positive experiences. For those who said there were barriers, the cost and the struggle to find sympathetic doctors were often cited as challenges. â€œI was flat out turned down by the primary care physician who had to give the go-ahead to give me a referral to an endocrinologist; I was just shut down. That was it, end of story.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 50s â€œI have not had surgery, because I canâ€™t access surgery. So unless I get breast cancer and have a double mastectomy, surgery is just not going to happen â€¦ because my health insurance wouldnâ€™t cover something like that. â€¦ It would be an out-of-pocket plastic surgery expense and I canâ€™t afford that at this time.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 50s â€œWhy do I need the permission of a therapist to say, â€˜This personâ€™s identity is valid,â€™ before I can get the health care that I need to be me, that is vital for myself and for my way of life?â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-40s â€œ[My doctor] is basically the first person that actually embraced me and made me accept [who I am].â€ â€“ Trans woman, late 20s Many people who transitioned in previous decades described how access has gotten much easier in recent years. Some described relying on underground networks to learn which doctors would help them obtain medical care or where to obtain hormones illegally. â€œIt was hard financially because I started so long ago, just didnâ€™t have access like that. Sometimes you have to try to go to Mexico or learn about someone in Mexico that was a pharmacist, I can remember that. That was a big thing, going through the border to Mexico, that was wild. So, it was just hard financially because they would charge so much for testosterone. And there was the whole bodybuilding community. If you were transitioning, you went to bodybuilders, and they would charge you five times what they got it [for], so it was kind of tough.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 40s â€œIt was a lot harder to get a surgeon when I started transitioning; insurance was out of the question, there wasnâ€™t really a national discussion around trans people and their particular medical needs. So, it was challenging having to pay everything out of pocket at a young age.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 30s â€œI guess it was hard for me to access hormones initially just because you had to jump through so many hoops, get letters, and then you had to find a provider that was willing to write it. And now itâ€™s like people are getting it from their primary care doctor, which is great, but a very different experience than I had.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 40s Connections with the broader LGBTQ+ community (Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images) The discussions also touched on whether the participants feel a connection with a broader lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) community or with other people who are LGBTQ+. Views varied, with some saying they feel an immediate connection with other people who are LGBTQ+, even with those who arenâ€™t trans or nonbinary, and others saying they donâ€™t necessarily feel this way. â€œItâ€™s kind of a recurring joke where you can meet another LGBT person and it is like there is an immediate understanding, and you are basically talking and giving each other emotional support, like you have been friends for 10-plus years.â€ â€“ Trans woman, late teens â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s automatic friendship between queer people, thereâ€™s like a kinship, but I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s automatic friendship or anything. I think itâ€™s just normal, like, how normal people make friends, just based on common interests.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œI do think of myself as part of the LGBT [community] â€¦ I use the resources that are put in place for these communities, whether thatâ€™s different health care programs, support groups, they have the community centers. â€¦ So, I do consider myself to be part of this community, and Iâ€™m able to hopefully take when needed, as well as give back.â€ â€“ Trans man, mid-30s â€œI feel like thatâ€™s such an important part of being a part of the [LGBTQ+] alphabet soup community, that process of constantly learning and listening to each other and â€¦ growing and developing language together â€¦ I love that aspect of creating who we are together, learning and unlearning together, and I feel like thatâ€™s a part of at least the queer community spaces that I want to be in. Thatâ€™s something thatâ€™s core to me.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œI identify as queer. I feel like Iâ€™m a part of the LGBT community. Thatâ€™s more of a part of my identity than being trans. â€¦ Before I came out as trans, I identified as a lesbian. That was also a big part of my identity. So, that may be too why I feel like Iâ€™m more part of the LGB community.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 40s While many trans and nonbinary participants said they felt accepted by others in the LGBTQ+ community, some participants described their gender identity as a barrier to full acceptance. There was a sense among some participants that cisgender people who are lesbian, gay or bisexual donâ€™t always accept people who are transgender or nonbinary. â€œI would really like to be included in the [LGBTQ+] community. But I have seen some people try to separate the T from LGB â€¦ Iâ€™ve run into a few situations throughout my time navigating the [LGBTQ+] community where Iâ€™ve been perceived â€“ and I just want to say that thereâ€™s nothing wrong with this â€“ Iâ€™ve been perceived as like a more feminine or gay man in a social setting, even though Iâ€™m heterosexual. â€¦ But the minute that that person found out that I wasnâ€™t a gay man â€¦ and that I was actually a transgender person, they became cold and just distancing themselves. And Iâ€™ve been in a lot of those types of circumstances where thereâ€™s that divide between the rest of the community.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 30s â€œThere are some lesbians who see trans men as being traitors to womanhood. Those are not people that I really identify with or want to be close to.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 40s â€œItâ€™s only in the past maybe dozen or so years, that an identity like gender fluid or gender queer was acceptable even within the LGBTQ+ community. â€¦ I tried to go to certain LGBTQ+ events as a trans man and, you know, I was not allowed in because I looked too female. The gay men would not allow me to participate.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 50s â€œTechnically based on the letters [in the acronym LGBTQ+] I am part of that community, but Iâ€™ve felt discrimination, itâ€™s very heavily exclusive to people who are either gay or lesbian and I think thatâ€™s true â€¦ for queer or bisexual or asexual, intersex â€¦ anybody whoâ€™s not like exclusively hardcore gay or lesbian. Itâ€™s very exclusive, like excluding to those people. â€¦ I feel like the BTQ is a separate group of peopleâ€¦. So, I identify with the second half of the letters as a separate subset.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s Policy and social change (Steve Ahlquist/Uprise RI) When asked to name the most important policy or political issues facing transgender and nonbinary people in the United States today, many participants named basic needs such as housing, employment, and health care. Others cited recent legislation or policies related to people who are transgender that have made national news. â€œHousing is a huge issue. Health care might be good in New York, it might be good in California, but â€¦ itâ€™s not a national equality for trans folks. Health care is not equal across the states. Housing is not equal across the states. So, I think that the issues right now that weâ€™re all facing is health care and housing. Thatâ€™s the top, the most important things.â€ â€“ Trans woman, early 40s â€œDefinitely education. I think thatâ€™s very important â€¦ Whether you identify as trans or not as a young child, itâ€™s good to understand and know the different things under the umbrella, the queer umbrella. And it is also just a respect thing. And also, the violence that happens against trans and nonbinary people. I feel like educating them very young, that kind of helps â€“ well, it is going to help because once you understand whatâ€™s going on and you see somebody that doesnâ€™t identify the same as you, youâ€™ll have that respect, or youâ€™ll have that understanding and youâ€™re less likely to be very violent towards them.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-20s â€œEmployment is a big one. And I know that some areas, more metropolitan progressive-leaning areas, are really on top of this, but theyâ€™re trans people everywhere that are still being discriminated against. I think itâ€™s a personal thing for me that goes back to my military service, but still, itâ€™s just unfortunate. Itâ€™s an unfortunate reality.â€ â€“ Trans man, early 30s â€œI think just the strong intersectionality of trans people with mental health issues, or even physical health issues. â€¦ So in that way, accessing good health care or having good mental health.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s â€œI honestly think that the situation in Texas is the most pressing political and policy situation because it is a direct attack on the trans community. â€¦ And it is so insidious because it doesnâ€™t just target bathrooms. This is saying that if you provide medical care to trans youth it is tantamount to child abuse. And it is so enraging because it is a known proven fact that access to gender affirming medical care saves lives. It saves the lives of trans youth. And trans youth have the highest suicide rate in the country.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-40s Participants had different takes on what gets in the way of progress on issues facing transgender and nonbinary people. Some pointed to the lack of knowledge surrounding the history of these issues or not knowing someone who is transgender or nonbinary. Others mentioned misconceptions people might have about transgender and nonbinary people that influence their political and policy perspectives. â€œPeople who donâ€™t know trans people, honestly â€¦ thatâ€™s the only barrier I can understand because people fear what they donâ€™t know and then react to it a lot of the time.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œSometimes even if they know someone, they still donâ€™t consider them to be a human being, they are an â€˜other,â€™ they are an â€˜it,â€™ they are a â€˜not like me,â€™ â€˜not like my family,â€™ person and so they are put into a place socially where they can be treated badly.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 50s â€œJust the ignorance and misinformation and this quick fake social media fodder, where it encourages people who should not be part of the conversation to spread things that are not true.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s â€œAlso, the political issues that face nonbinary people, itâ€™s that people think nonbinary is some made-up thing to feel cool. Itâ€™s not to feel cool. And if someone does do it to feel cool, maybe theyâ€™re just doing that because they donâ€™t feel comfortable within themselves.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-30s â€œThereâ€™s so much fear around it, and misunderstanding, and people thinking that if youâ€™re talking to kids about gender and sexuality, that itâ€™s sexual. And itâ€™s like, we really need to break down that our bodies are not inherently sexual. We need to be able to talk with students and children about their bodies so that they can then feel empowered to understand themselves, advocate for themselves.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s When asked what makes them hopeful for the future for trans and nonbinary people, some participants pointed to the way things in society have already changed and progress that has been made. For example, some mentioned greater representation and visibility of transgender and nonbinary people in entertainment and other industries, while others focused on changing societal views as things that give them hope for the future. â€œI am hopeful about the future because I see so many of us coming out and being visible and representing and showing folks that we are not to stereotype.â€ â€“ Trans woman, early 40s â€œAlso, even though celebrity is annoying, itâ€™s still cool when people like Willow [Smith] or Billie Eilish or all these popstars that the kids really love are like, â€˜Iâ€™m nonbinary, Iâ€™m queer,â€™ like a lot more progressive. â€¦ Even just more visibility in TV shows and movies, the more and more that happens the more itâ€™s like, â€˜Oh yeah, we are really here, you canâ€™t not see us.â€™â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 20s â€œWe shouldnâ€™t have to look to the entertainment industry for role models, we shouldnâ€™t have to, we should be able to look to our leaders, our political leaders, but I think, thatâ€™s what gives me hope. Soon, itâ€™s going to become a nonissue, maybe in my lifetime.â€ â€“ Trans man, 60s â€œI have gotten a little bit into stand-up comedy in the last few weeks, and it is like the jokes that people made ten years ago are resurfacing online and people are enraged about it. They are saying like, â€˜Oh, this is totally inappropriate.â€™ But that comes with the recognition that things have changed, and language has changed, and people are becoming more intolerant of allowing these things to occur. So that is why I am hopeful, is being able to see that progression and hopeful continued improvement on that front.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, late 20s â€œI think because of the shift of whatâ€™s happening, how everything has become so normal, and people are being more open, and within the umbrella of queerness so many different things are happening, I think as we get more comfortable and we progress as a society, itâ€™s just going to be better. So, people donâ€™t have to hide who they are. So, that gives me hope.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, mid-20s For many, young people are a source of hope. Several participants talked about younger generations being more accepting of those who are transgender or nonbinary and also being more accepted by their families if they themselves are trans or nonbinary. â€œAnd then the other portion that gives me hope are the kids, because I work now with so many kids who are coming out as trans earlier and their families are embracing them and everything. â€¦ So I really am trusting in the young generation.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, 60s â€œI mean kids donâ€™t judge you the same way as adults do about gender, and theyâ€™re so expansive and have so much creativity. â€¦ So itâ€™s just the kids, Gen Z, and it just makes me feel really, really hopeful.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œThe youth, the youth. They understand almost intrinsically so much more about these things than I feel like my generation did. They give me so much hope for the future.â€ â€“ Nonbinary person, early 30s â€œI think future generations, just seeing this growing amount of support that they have, that itâ€™s just going to keep improving â€¦ thereâ€™s an increase in visibility but thereâ€™s also an increase in support â€¦ like resources for parents where they can see that they donâ€™t have to punish their kids. Their kids can grow up feeling like, â€˜This is okay to be this way.â€™ And I feel like thatâ€™s not something that can be stopped.â€ â€“ Trans man, late 30s Additional materials aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Acknowledgments aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Methodology aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Topline Lead photo: (Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images) Next: Methodology â† Prev Page You are reading page1Page2Page3 Next Page â†’ [weekly.svg] Social Trends Monthly Newsletter Sign up to to receive a monthly digest of the Center's latest research on the attitudes and behaviors of Americans in key realms of daily life ____________________ Sign Up Pew Research Center 1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20036 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries Research Topics Politics &amp; PolicyInternational AffairsImmigration &amp; MigrationRace &amp; EthnicityReligionAge &amp; GenerationsGender &amp; LGBTQ Family &amp; RelationshipsEconomy &amp; WorkScienceInternet &amp; TechnologyNews Habits &amp; MediaMethodological ResearchFull topic list Follow Us Email Newsletters Instagram Twitter LinkedIn YouTube RSS About Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

While individuals may be assigned to a sex at birth based on how they present biologically, their sense of their gender may differ. A trans man is a man who was identified as female at birth, and a trans woman is a woman who was identified as male. (Transsexual is an older term that referred to trans individuals who sought or undertook intervention to change their bodies.) Many trans people, but not all, take steps, either through surgery, hormone treatments, or cosmetic or fashion decisions, to make their bodies and appearances align with their gender identitiesâ€”the gender with which they identifyâ€”whether male-to-female or female-to-male. These steps, which also may include changing oneâ€™s name and/or pronouns, are often referred to as transitioning, or as gender affirmation, although the term gender reassignment is used by some. (Cross-dressers, distinct from transgender individuals, generally identify with the gender label they receive at birth but often wear clothing associated with a different gender.) Gender has increasingly come to be recognized as existing on a continuum. Some people whose self-concept falls outside the traditional binary constructs of male and female, for example, identify as genderqueer. Others living outside of these binary constructs may identify as nonbinary, gender-nonconforming or third gender. These individuals may or may not also identify as transgender. Contents aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls The Transgender Experience aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls The Lives of Transgender Youth The Transgender Experience Any person who identifies differently from the gender they were assigned at birth is transgender. There is no single source of transgender identity. Biological and genetic factors may play a role before a person is born, but personal experiences, in childhood, adolescence, or beyond, may also contribute to oneâ€™s gender identity, or at least to oneâ€™s awareness of it and comfort disclosing it. The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates that there are 1.4 million adults in the U.S. who identify as transgender, representing 0.7 percent of people between ages 18 and 24 and 0.5 percent of those older than 65. Other experts believe the actual number of trans Americans may be closer to 2 million. The Williams Institute also estimates that 150,000 U.S. residents between ages 13 and 17 are transgender. What is gender dysphoria? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. Beginning as early as childhood, a transgender person may have feelings of disconnection between their primary and secondary sex traits and designated gender and the gender with which they identify. People who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), may receive a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Itâ€™s a diagnosis that has been widely debated in the psychological and transgender communities because many see it as unnecessarily pathologizing of trans people, although getting a diagnosis can help some individuals access mental health care, and insurance coverage, they might otherwise not be able to take advantage of. While some children who experience such feelings do not go on to identify as transgender in adulthood, long-standing gender dysphoria is a common experience among adults who do identify as transgender. For more, see Gender Dysphoria. Does a person have to transition their gender to be transgender? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. No, but many do. Transitioning, or gender affirmation, is a complex process, one that begins not with medical procedures but with expressing one's identity, to themselves and to others with whom they feel safe. Reaching out to transgender community groups, or meeting with a mental health professional who provides affirmative care for transgender people are often among the first steps in the process. Different individuals follow different paths to gender affirmation: Some may change their name or pronouns, and/or change their clothing or appearance in nonmedical ways, while others will seek hormone therapy treatments and surgical procedures, often at significant expense, that modify their body to conform with their gender identity. Are trans people also homosexual? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. They may be. An individualâ€™s gender or gender identity does not determine their sexual orientation. Trans people, like any other individuals, may be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, or none of the above. Trans people commonly refer to their sexual orientation in terms of their gender identity: For example, a trans woman attracted to women would most likely consider herself to be a lesbian or gay woman. Do trans people date heterosexual nontrans partners? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. They can, but they often donâ€™t, in part because of persistent transphobia and resistance to such pairings among the heterosexual, cisgender population. For example, in one recent study, less than 3 percent of heterosexual cisgender people said they would consider dating a trans individual, while 12 percent of nontransgender gay men, 29 percent of nontransgender lesbians, and slightly more than half of people who identified as bisexual, queer, or nonbinary, reported that they would. Is being transgender a mental health disorder? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. No. Despite past misconceptions and persistent myths, being trans is not a mental health disorder. Mental health conditions by definition cause individuals significant distress or disability, while for trans people, affirmation of their identity is often a source of relief. However, many people struggling with expressing their gender identity, or facing discrimination, rejection, obstacles, or abuse because of it, may become depressed or anxious, or experience suicidal ideation. It is important that they seek out therapy or treatment from a mental health professional. What social and political challenges do trans people face? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. Transgender awareness has grown in recent years, especially as more trans people have become prominent in pop culture and as more young people speak out about their identities at earlier ages than trans people in earlier generations may have. According to one survey, 62 percent of adults in the U.S. now say they support trans rights, as opposed to 29 percent just five years earlier. Today, 30 percent of Americans say they personally know a trans person. But trans individuals still face significant social bias, stigma, abuse, violence, and legal discrimination, as well as a lingering perception based on outdated myths that they are mentally ill, socially deviant, or sexually predatory. Hate crimes have been frequently perpetuated against members of the transgender community. A majority of trans people report having experienced intimate partner violence, and nearly half report having been sexually assaulted, according to research by advocacy group Human Rights Campaign. Nearly 1 in 10 trans individuals report being physically assaulted each year, and dozens have been violently killed in the U.S. in recent years. Trans people are more likely to live in poverty and without health care than others, in part due to bias that limits their opportunities in the workforce. And trans individuals of racial or ethnic minority backgrounds generally report higher levels of discrimination of all kinds. In some states, legislatures have supported laws barring trans people from using public bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity or competing in athletic competition against those who share their gender identity. Many anti-discrimination statutes are not written, or have not been updated, to legally protect the civil rights of trans people, although more communities are passing laws or taking other legal actions to affirm the rights or trans individuals. How can I support trans individuals in my family, office, or community? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. Use names and pronouns that fit their stated preference and gender. Do not make assumptions, such as about their sexual orientation or that they must be pursuing hormonal or surgical treatments. Learn about trans identity from books, organizations, or trusted websites, and ask questions of a friend or loved on with an open mind. If you are struggling with your own feelings about a partner, parent, child, or close friend expressing a different gender identity, donâ€™t feel ashamed or guilty about it, but do seek support from a mental health professional to help you take steps to maintain your strong relationship. article continues after advertisement The Lives of Transgender Youth For many adolescents and young adults, the journey to confidently declaring their gender identity and beginning to live as the gender that suits them ends in positivity, greater self-confidence, and higher self-esteem. But the path to that point often involves intense mental and emotional stress. Questioning oneâ€™s own identity, and reckoning with the ramifications of the conclusions, can upend oneâ€™s previous beliefs, and re-entering life as a different gender may lead to a loss of friendships and the jeopardizing of family connections, as well as bullying and discrimination, often violent, at school and in the community. Research suggests that as many as two-thirds of transgender adolescents have had suicidal thoughts, as compared to 13 percent of other teens. But the presence of supportive others in a young transgender personâ€™s life, especially parents, can make a significant difference: For example, 64 percent of transgender teens who felt supported by parents reported having high self-esteem, as opposed to just 13 percent of those who did not. How do people come to understand that they are transgender? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. People can become aware of their transgender identity at any age. Some become conscious of their identity as young children, and many who become aware of it in adolescence or adulthood can look back at early experiences of not feeling that they fit in with others from the gender to which they were assigned at birth. Many transgender individuals experience not just a sense of discomfort but intense dissatisfaction with their assigned sex or sexual characteristics, or the roles they are expected to play as presumed members of one gender or another. These feelings of gender dissonance can lead to depression and even suicidal ideation without an outlet to share them or support from family or friends. Some quickly and readily embrace their trans identity; others may not find such gender resonance until they encounter others who have had the same experience and with whom they can identify. But at any age, trans people may struggle with their identities, and may experience confusion, shame, or guilt, especially if their family, peer group, or community is not supportive of identities along the gender spectrum. How can a parent support a gender non-conforming child? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. By not rejecting them or dismissing their statements, but by being affirming and becoming their ally and advocate, in the family, in their school, and if necessary, in the broader community. Some children may appear to be gender non-conforming from an early age, and may experience distress or anxiety about their identity or the expectations placed on them because of what others assume to be their gender; their interactions with peers may be especially stressful. Parents should not assume, or insist, that these feelings merely represent a â€œphase,â€ nor should they encourage or force a child to conform to a gender role that nay not fit their identity. Learning as much as they can about the trans experience, including reading about the experiences of other parents, can be helpful. How can a parent support a transitioning child? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. By standing with them through their disclosures, medical decisions, and appointments, and by taking everyday steps like using their childâ€™s chosen pronoun, or working with them to choose a new name. Transitioning at a young age may involve harrowing decisions which generally require parental consent, such as considering whether to take medication to block or delay puberty. Becoming informed about the ramifications of such medical decisions, and discussing them openly with a child and their doctor, can help to lessen a young personâ€™s anxiety. What is â€œrapid-onsetâ€ gender dysphoria? (BUTTON) Created with Sketch. â€œRapid-onsetâ€ gender dysphoria is a discredited term used by some to describe the apparent phenomenon of young people declaring themselves to be transgender all of a sudden, suggesting that these individuals have been influenced by social media, popular culture, or even peer pressure. The term has been used by some to explain the increased numbers of transgender youth in recent years, particularly in communities where the numbers seem to be unexpectedly high. However, the 2018 paper on which this theory is based has been widely debunked for, among other reasons, the fact that its survey participants were parents who already believed that their children had changed their gender identity with no previous warning. No actual trans youth were studied to formulate the paperâ€™s conclusions. While the theory has gained traction in some circles and continues to be used to question the sincerity of some transgender youth, the journal that published the paper has published a correction, stating, â€œRapid-onset gender dysphoria is not a formal mental health diagnosis at this time. This report did not collect data from the adolescents and young adults (AYAs) or clinicians and therefore does not validate the phenomenon." Essential Reads How Do I Come Out as Trans or Nonbinary?

These findings are part of a larger project that includes findings from six focus groups on the experiences and views of transgender and nonbinary adults and estimates of the share of U.S. adults who say their gender is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. This analysis is based on a survey of 10,188 U.S. adults. The data was collected as a part of a larger survey conducted May 16-22, 2022. Everyone who took part is a member of the Centerâ€™s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATPâ€™s methodology. See here to read more about the questions used for this report and the reportâ€™s methodology. Terminology (BUTTON) References to White, Black and Asian adults include only those who are not Hispanic and identify as only one race. Hispanics are of any race. All references to party affiliation include those who lean toward that party. Republicans include those who identify as Republicans and those who say they lean toward the Republican Party. Democrats include those who identify as Democrats and those who say they lean toward the Democratic Party. References to college graduates or people with a college degree comprise those with a bachelorâ€™s degree or more. â€œSome collegeâ€ includes those with an associate degree and those who attended college but did not obtain a degree. The terms â€œtransgenderâ€ and â€œtransâ€ are used interchangeably throughout this report to refer to people whose gender is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. A chart showing Most favor protecting trans people from discrimination, even as growing share say gender is determined by sex at birth As the United States addresses issues of transgender rights and the broader landscape around gender identity continues to shift, the American public holds a complex set of views around these issues, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults say there is at least some discrimination against transgender people in our society, and a majority favor laws that would protect transgender individuals from discrimination in jobs, housing and public spaces. At the same time, 60% say a personâ€™s gender is determined by their sex assigned at birth, up from 56% in 2021 and 54% in 2017. The public is divided over the extent to which our society has accepted people who are transgender: 38% say society has gone too far in accepting them, while a roughly equal share (36%) say society hasnâ€™t gone far enough. About one-in-four say things have been about right. Underscoring the publicâ€™s ambivalence around these issues, even among those who see at least some discrimination against trans people, a majority (54%) say society has either gone too far or been about right in terms of acceptance. The fundamental belief about whether gender can differ from sex assigned at birth is closely aligned with opinions on transgender issues. Americans who say a personâ€™s gender can be different from their sex at birth are more likely than others to see discrimination against trans people and a lack of societal acceptance. Theyâ€™re also more likely to say that our society hasnâ€™t gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender. But even among those who say a personâ€™s gender is determined by their sex at birth, there is a diversity of viewpoints. Half of this group say they would favor laws that protect trans people from discrimination in certain realms of life. And about one-in-four say forms and online profiles should include options other than â€œmaleâ€ or â€œfemaleâ€ for people who donâ€™t identify as either. Related: The Experiences, Challenges and Hopes of Transgender and Nonbinary U.S. adults Chart showing Young adults, Democrats more likely to say society hasnâ€™t gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender When it comes to issues surrounding gender identity, young adults are at the leading edge of change and acceptance. Half of adults ages 18 to 29 say someone can be a man or a woman even if that differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. This compares with about four-in-ten of those ages 30 to 49 and about a third of those 50 and older. Adults younger than 30 are also more likely than older adults to say society hasnâ€™t gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender (47% vs. 39% of 30- to 49-year-olds and 31% of those 50 and older) These views differ even more sharply by partisanship. Democrats and those who lean to the Democratic Party are more than four times as likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say that a personâ€™s gender can be different from the sex they were assigned at birth (61% vs. 13%). Democrats are also much more likely than Republicans to say our society hasnâ€™t gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender (59% vs. 10%). For their part, 66% of Republicans say society has gone too far in accepting people who are transgender. Amid a national conversation over these issues, many states are considering or have put in place laws or policies that would directly affect the lives of transgender and nonbinary people â€“ that is, those who donâ€™t identify as a man or a woman. Some of these laws would limit protections for transgender and nonbinary people; others are aimed at safeguarding them. The survey finds that a majority of U.S. adults (64%) say they would favor laws that would protect transgender individuals from discrimination in jobs, housing and public spaces such as restaurants and stores. But there is also a fair amount of support for specific proposals that would limit how trans people can participate in certain activities and navigate their day-to-day lives. Roughly six-in-ten adults (58%) favor proposals that would require transgender athletes to compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth (17% oppose this, 24% neither favor nor oppose).^1 And 46% favor making it illegal for health care professionals to provide someone younger than 18 with medical care for a gender transition (31% oppose). The public is more evenly split when it comes to making it illegal for public school districts to teach about gender identity in elementary schools (41% favor and 38% oppose) and investigating parents for child abuse if they help someone younger than 18 get medical care for a gender transition (37% favor and 36% oppose). Across the board, views on these policies are deeply divided by party. Views of laws and policies related to transgender issues differ widely by party When asked what has influenced their views on gender identity â€“ specifically, whether they believe a person can be a different gender than the sex they were assigned at birth â€“ those who believe gender can be different from sex at birth and those who do not point to different factors. For the former group, the most influential factors shaping their views are what theyâ€™ve learned from science (40% say this has influenced their views a great deal or a fair amount) and knowing someone who is transgender (38%). Some 46% of those who say gender is determined by sex at birth also point to what theyâ€™ve learned from science, but this group is far more likely than those who say a personâ€™s gender can be different from their sex at birth to say their religious beliefs have had at least a fair amount of influence on their opinion (41% vs. 9%). The nationally representative survey of 10,188 U.S. adults was conducted May 16-22, 2022. Previously published findings from the survey show that 1.6% of U.S. adults are trans or nonbinary, and the share is higher among adults younger than 30. More than four-in-ten U.S. adults know someone who is trans and 20% know someone who is nonbinary. Among the other key findings in this report: Nearly half of U.S. adults (47%) say itâ€™s extremely or very important to use a personâ€™s new name if they transition to a gender that is different from the sex they were assigned at birth and change their name. A smaller share (34%) say the same about using someoneâ€™s new pronouns (such as â€œheâ€ instead of â€œsheâ€). A majority of Democrats (64%) â€“ compared with 28% of Republicans â€“ say itâ€™s at least very important to use someoneâ€™s new name if they go through a gender transition and change their name. And while 51% of Democrats say itâ€™s extremely or very important to use someoneâ€™s new pronouns, just 14% of Republicans say the same. Many Americans express discomfort with the pace of change around issues of gender identity. Some 43% say views on issues related to people who are transgender or nonbinary are changing too quickly, while 26% say things arenâ€™t changing quickly enough and 28% say the pace of change is about right. Adults ages 65 and older are the most likely to say views on these issues are changing too quickly; conversely, those younger than 30 are the most likely to say theyâ€™re not changing quickly enough. More than four-in-ten (44%) say forms and online profiles that ask about a personâ€™s gender should include options other than â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemaleâ€ for people who donâ€™t identify as either. Some 38% say the same about government documents such as passports and driverâ€™s licenses. Half of adults younger than 30 say government documents that ask about a personâ€™s gender should provide more than two gender options, compared with about four-in-ten or fewer among those in older age groups. Views differ even more widely by party: While majorities of Democrats say forms and online profiles (64%) and government documents (58%) should offer options other than â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemale,â€ about eight-in-ten Republicans say they should not (79% say this about forms and online profiles and 83% say this about government documents). Democrats and Republicans who agree that a personâ€™s gender is determined by their sex at birth often have different views on transgender issues. A majority (61%) of Democrats â€“ but just 31% of Republicans â€“ who say a personâ€™s gender is determined by the sex they were assigned at birth say there is at least a fair amount of discrimination against transgender people in our society today. And while 62% of Democrats who say gender is determined by sex at birth say they would favor policies that protect trans individuals against discrimination, fewer than half of their Republican counterparts say the same. Democratsâ€™ views on some transgender issues vary by age. Among Democrats younger than 30, about seven-in-ten (72%) say someone can be a man or a woman even if thatâ€™s different from the sex they were assigned at birth, and 66% say society hasnâ€™t gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender. Smaller majorities of Democrats 30 and older express these views. Age is less of a factor among Republicans. In fact, similar shares of Republicans ages 18 to 29 and those 65 and older say a personâ€™s gender is determined by their sex at birth (88% each) and that society has gone too far in accepting people who are transgender (67% of Republicans younger than 30 and 69% of those 65 and older). About three-in-ten parents of K-12 students (29%) say at least one of their children has learned about people who are transgender or nonbinary from a teacher or another adult at their school. Similar shares across regions and in urban, suburban and rural areas say their children have learned about this in school, as do similar shares of Republican and Democratic parents. Views on whether itâ€™s good or bad that their children have or havenâ€™t learned about people who are trans or nonbinary at school vary by party and by childrenâ€™s age. For example, among parents of children in elementary school, 45% say either that their children have learned about this and thatâ€™s a bad thing or that they havenâ€™t learned about it and thatâ€™s a good thing. A smaller share of parents of middle and high schoolers (34%) say the same. Republican parents are much more likely than Democratic parents to say this, regardless of their childâ€™s age. A rising share say a personâ€™s gender is determined by their sex at birth Majority of U.S. adults say gender is determined by sex assigned at birth Six-in-ten U.S. adults say that whether a person is a man or a woman is determined by their sex assigned at birth. This is up from 56% one year ago and 54% in 2017. No single demographic group is driving this change, and patterns in who is more likely to say this are similar to what they were in past years. Today, half or more in all age groups say that gender is determined by sex assigned at birth, but this is a less common view among younger adults. Half of adults younger than 30 say this, lower than the 60% of 30- to 49-year-olds who say the same. Even higher shares of those 50 to 64 (66%) and those 65 and older (64%) say a personâ€™s gender is determined by their sex at birth. The party gap on this issue remains wide. The vast majority of Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP say gender is determined by sex assigned at birth (86%), compared with 38% of Democrats and Democratic leaners. Most Democrats say that whether a person is a man or a woman can be different from their sex at birth (61% vs. just 13% of Republicans). Liberal Democrats are particularly likely to hold this view â€“ 79% say a personâ€™s gender can be different from sex at birth, compared with 45% of moderate or conservative Democrats. Meanwhile, 92% of conservative Republicans say gender is determined by sex at birth and 74% of moderate or liberal Republicans agree. Democrats ages 18 to 29 are also substantially more likely than older Democrats to say that someoneâ€™s gender can be different from their sex assigned at birth, although majorities of Democrats across age groups share this view. About seven-in-ten Democrats younger than 30 say this (72%), compared with about six-in-ten or fewer in the older age groups. Among Republicans, there is no clear pattern by age. About eight-in-ten or more Republicans across age groups â€“ including 88% each among those ages 18 to 29 and those 65 and older â€“ say a personâ€™s gender is determined by their sex at birth. The view that a personâ€™s gender is determined by their sex assigned at birth is more common among those with lower levels of educational attainment and those living in rural areas or in the Midwest or South. This view is also more prevalent among men and Black Americans. A solid majority of those who do not know a transgender person say that whether a person is a man or a woman is determined by sex assigned at birth (68%), while those who do know a trans person are more evenly split. About half say gender is determined by sex assigned at birth (51%), while 48% say gender and sex assigned at birth can be different. Though Republicans who know a trans person are more likely than Republicans who donâ€™t to say gender can be different from sex assigned at birth, more than eight-in-ten in both groups (83% and 88%, respectively) say gender is determined by sex at birth. Meanwhile, there are large differences between Democrats who do and do not know a transgender person. A majority of Democrats who do know a trans person (72%) say someone can be a man or a woman even if that differs from their sex assigned at birth, while those who donâ€™t know anyone who is transgender are about evenly split (48% say gender is determined by sex assigned at birth while 51% say it can be different). Many Americans point to science when asked what has influenced their views on whether gender can differ from sex assigned at birth When asked about factors that have influenced their views about whether someoneâ€™s gender can be different from the sex they were assigned at birth, 44% say what theyâ€™ve learned from science has had a great deal or a fair amount of influence. About three-in-ten (28%) point to their religious views and about two-in-ten (22%) say knowing someone who is transgender has influenced their views at least a fair amount. Smaller shares say what theyâ€™ve heard or read in the news (15%) or on social media (14%) has had a great deal or a fair amount of influence on their views. Chart showing More than four-in-ten U.S. adults say science has influenced their views of gender and sex at least a fair amount The factors people point to on this topic differ by whether or not they say gender is determined by sex at birth. Among those who say that whether someone is a man or a woman is determined by the sex they were assigned at birth, 46% say what theyâ€™ve learned from science has influenced their views on this at least a fair amount, while 41% say the same about their religious views. About one-in-ten point to what theyâ€™ve heard or read in the news (12%), what theyâ€™ve heard or read on social media (11%) or knowing someone whoâ€™s transgender (11%). Among those who say someone can be a man or a woman even if thatâ€™s different from the sex they were assigned at birth, 40% say their views on this topic have been influenced at least a fair amount by what theyâ€™ve learned from science. A similar share say the same about knowing a transgender person (38%). Smaller shares in this group say what theyâ€™ve heard or read in the news (19%) or on social media (18%) or their religious views (9%) have had a great deal or a fair amount of influence. Among those who say gender is determined by sex assigned at birth, adults younger than 30 stand out as being more likely than their older counterparts to say their knowledge of science (60%), what theyâ€™ve heard or read on social media (22%) or knowing someone who is trans (17%) influenced this view a great deal or a fair amount. In turn, those ages 65 and older tend to be more likely than younger age groups to cite their religious views (51% in the older group say this has had at least a fair amount of influence). Republicans who say gender is determined by sex assigned at birth are more likely than Democrats with the same view to say their knowledge of science (52% vs. 40%) and their religious views (45% vs. 34%) have had at least a fair amount of influence, while Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say the news (17% vs. 10%), social media (16% vs. 10%) and knowing someone who is trans (15% vs. 9%) have influenced them â€“ though the shares are still small among both groups. U.S. adults with different viewpoints on gender and sex say their opinions have been influenced by different factors On the flip side, among those who say someoneâ€™s gender can be different from the sex they were assigned at birth, adults younger than 30 are also more likely than older adults to say social media has contributed to this view at least a fair amount (33% vs. 15% or fewer among older age groups). Adults ages 65 and older are more likely than their younger counterparts to say what theyâ€™ve learned from science has influenced their view (46% vs. 40% or fewer). Democrats who say whether someone is a man or a woman can be different from their sex at birth are more likely than Republicans with the same view to say that what theyâ€™ve learned from science (43% vs. 26%) and knowing someone who is transgender (40% vs. 26%) has influenced their view a great deal or a fair amount. Public sees discrimination against trans people and limited acceptance Roughly eight-in-ten Americans say transgender people face at least some discrimination, and relatively few believe our society is extremely or very accepting of people who are trans. These views differ widely by partisanship and by beliefs about whether someoneâ€™s gender can differ from the sex they were assigned at birth. Overall, 57% of adults say there is a great deal or a fair amount of discrimination against transgender people in our society today. An additional 21% say there is some discrimination against trans people, and 14% say there is a little or none at all. There are modest differences in views on this issue across demographic groups. Women (62%) are more likely than men (52%) to say there is a great deal or a fair amount of discrimination against transgender people, and college graduates (62%) are more likely than those with less education (55%) to say the same. Chart showing Most Americans say there is at least some discrimination against trans people in the U.S. There is, however, a wide partisan divide in these views: While 76% of Democrats and those who lean to the Democratic Party say there is a great deal or a fair amount of discrimination against trans people, 35% of Republicans and Republican leaners share that assessment. One-in-four Republicans see little or no discrimination against this group, compared with 5% of Democrats. These views are also linked with underlying opinions about whether a personâ€™s gender can be different from their sex assigned at birth. Among those who say someone can be a man or a woman even if thatâ€™s different from the sex they were assigned at birth, 83% say there is a great deal or a fair amount of discrimination against trans people. Even so, some 42% of those who hold the alternative point of view â€“ that gender is determined by sex assigned at birth â€“ also see at least a fair amount of discrimination. Among Democrats who say gender is determined by sex at birth, that share rises to 61%. Relatively few adults (14%) say society is extremely or very accepting, while about a third (35%) say it is somewhat accepting. A plurality (44%) says our society is a little or not at all accepting of trans people. Chart showing Plurality of Americans say there is little or no societal acceptance of transgender people Again, these views are strongly linked with partisanship. Democrats have a much more negative view than Republicans, with 54% of Democrats saying society is a little accepting or not at all accepting of transgender people, compared with a third of Republicans. And, as with views of discrimination, assessments of societal acceptance are linked to underlying views about how gender is determined. Those who say oneâ€™s gender can be different from the sex they were assigned at birth see less acceptance: 56% say society is a little accepting or not accepting at all of people who are transgender. This compares with 37% among those who say gender is determined by sex at birth. Republicans who say gender is determined by sex at birth are more likely than Democrats who say the same to believe that society is at least somewhat accepting of people who are transgender (61% vs. 47%). About four-in-ten say society has gone too far in accepting trans people While a majority of Americans see at least a fair amount of discrimination against transgender people and relatively few see widespread acceptance, 38% say our society has gone too far in accepting them. Some 36% say society has not gone far enough in accepting people who are trans, and 23% say the level of acceptance has been about right. These views differ along demographic and partisan lines. Young adults (ages 18 to 29) and those with a bachelorâ€™s degree or more education are among the most likely to say society hasnâ€™t gone far enough in accepting people who are trans. Men, White adults and those without a four-year college degree are among the most likely to say society has gone too far in this regard. Chart showing Public is divided over whether society has gone too far or not far enough in accepting transgender people There is a wide partisan divide as well. Roughly six-in-ten Democrats (59%) say society hasnâ€™t gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender, while 15% say it has gone too far (24% say itâ€™s been about right). Republicansâ€™ views are almost the inverse: 10% say society hasnâ€™t gone far enough and 66% say itâ€™s gone too far (22% say itâ€™s been about right). Even among those who see at least some discrimination against trans people, a majority (54%) say society has either gone too far in accepting trans people or been about right; 44% say society hasnâ€™t gone far enough. Many say itâ€™s important to use someoneâ€™s new name, pronouns when theyâ€™ve gone through a gender transition Nearly half of adults say itâ€™s important to use someoneâ€™s new name if they change their name as part of a gender transition Nearly half of adults (47%) say itâ€™s extremely or very important that if a person who transitions to a gender thatâ€™s different from their sex assigned at birth changes their name, others refer to them by their new name. An additional 22% say this is somewhat important. Three-in-ten say this is a little or not at all important (18%) or that it shouldnâ€™t be done (12%). Smaller shares say that if a person transitions to a gender thatâ€™s different from their sex assigned at birth and starts going by different pronouns (such as â€œsheâ€ instead of â€œheâ€), itâ€™s important that others refer to them by their new pronouns. About a third (34%) say this is extremely or very important, and 21% say this is somewhat important. More than four-in-ten say this is a little or not at all important (26%) or it should not be done (18%). These views differ along many of the same dimensions as other topics asked about. While 80% of those who believe someoneâ€™s gender can be different from their sex assigned at birth also say itâ€™s extremely or very important to use a personâ€™s new name when theyâ€™ve gone through a gender transition, 27% of those who think gender is determined by oneâ€™s sex assigned at birth share this opinion. The pattern is similar when it comes to use of preferred pronouns. Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to say itâ€™s extremely or very important to refer to a person using their new name or pronouns. When it comes to pronouns, a majority of Republicans (55%), compared with only 17% of Democrats, say using someoneâ€™s new pronouns when theyâ€™ve been through a gender transition is not at all important or should not be done. Chart showing People who know a trans person place more importance on using a personâ€™s new name, pronouns if they transition There are some demographic differences as well, with women more likely than men and those with a four-year college degree more likely than those with less education to say itâ€™s extremely or very important to use a personâ€™s new name or pronouns when referring to them. In addition, people who say they know someone who is trans are more likely than those who do not to say this is extremely or very important. Even so, substantial shares of those who donâ€™t know a trans person view this as important. For example, 39% of those who donâ€™t know someone who is transgender say itâ€™s extremely or very important to refer to a person who goes through a gender transition and changes their name by their new name. Plurality of adults say views on gender identity issues are changing too quickly Many Americans are not comfortable with the pace of change thatâ€™s occurring around issues involving gender identity. Some 43% say views on issues related to people who are transgender and nonbinary are changing too quickly. About one-in-four (26%) say things are not changing quickly enough, and 28% say they are changing at about the right speed. Women (30%) are more likely than men (21%) to say views on these issues are not changing quickly enough, and adults younger than 30 are more likely than their older counterparts to say the same. Among those ages 18 to 29, 37% say views on these issues are not changing quickly enough; this compares with 26% of those ages 30 to 49, 22% of those ages 50 to 64 and 19% of those 65 and older. At the same time, White adults (46%) are more likely than Black (34%), Hispanic (39%) or Asian (31%) adults to say views are changing too quickly. Chart showing More than four-in-ten Americans say societal views on gender identity are changing too quickly Opinions also differ sharply by partisanship. Among Democrats, a plurality (42%) say views on issues involving transgender and nonbinary people are not changing fast enough, and 21% say they are changing too quickly. About a third (35%) say the speed is about right. By contrast, 70% of Republicans say views on these issues are changing too quickly, while only 7% say views arenâ€™t changing fast enough. About one-in-five Republicans (21%) say theyâ€™re changing at about the right speed. Respondents were asked in an open-ended format why they think views are changing too quickly or not quickly enough, when it comes to issues surrounding transgender and nonbinary people. For those who say things are changing too quickly, responses fell into several different categories. Some indicated that new ways of thinking about gender were inconsistent with their religious beliefs. Others expressed concern that the long-term consequences of medical gender transitions are not well-known, or that changing views on gender identity are merely a fad thatâ€™s being pushed by the media. Still others said they worry that thereâ€™s too much discussion of these issues in schools these days. For those who say views are not changing quickly enough, some pointed to discrimination and a lack of acceptance of trans and nonbinary people. Others pointed to legislative initiatives in some states aimed at restricting the rights of trans and nonbinary people. Many also said that too many people in our society arenâ€™t open to change when it comes to these issues.^2 In their own words: Why do some people think views on issues related to transgender people and those who donâ€™t identify as a man or a woman are changing too quickly? General concerns about the pace of change â€œThe issue is so new to me I canâ€™t keep up. I donâ€™t know what to think about all of this new information. Iâ€™m baffled by so many changes.â€ â€œIt takes quite a bit of time for society to accept changes. I have not been aware of this issue for very long. I am relatively conservative and feel that changes need time to be accepted.â€ Religious reasons â€œPeople now believe everyone should just forget about their birth identity and just go along with what they think they are. God made us all for a reason and if He intended us to pick our gender then there would be no reason to be born with specific male or female parts.â€ â€œI have a personal religious belief that sex is an essential part of our eternal identity and that identifying as something other than you are â€¦ just doesnâ€™t make a lot of sense.â€ â€œI believe GOD created a man and a woman. We have overstepped our bounds in messing with the miracle of life. I side with my creator.â€ Concerns about long-term medical consequences â€œWe do not know the long-term health problems of hormone therapy, especially in young children.â€ â€œMore time needs to pass to study mental, physical, emotional ramifications of medications &amp; surgeries, especially when done before puberty and/or adulthood.â€ â€œAccepting gender fluidity, especially for younger children, seems quick. Also, medical treatments related to gender for people under 18 seems to be being accepted without longer term studies.â€ Itâ€™s a fad/Driven by the media â€œI respect peopleâ€™s views about themselves, and I will refer to them in the way they want to be referred to, but I believe itâ€™s become trendy because itâ€™s being pushed so much in culture, especially for children.â€ â€œNews media, social media and entertainment media companies are trying to change, and it seems they have been succeeding in changing public opinion on this issue for many people.â€ â€œIt is encouraging kids who are easily influenced to participate in the â€˜inâ€™ fad when their brains are not fully developed.â€ Concerns about schools â€œElementary school students should not be subjected to instruction on sex identity, any questions the child asks should be referred to a parent.â€ â€œI think that young people are exposed to these issues at too early an age. I believe that it is up to the parents, and I oppose schools that want to include it in the â€˜curriculum.â€™â€ â€œItâ€™s being pushed on society and especially on younger children, confusing them all the more. This is not something that should be taught in schools.â€ In their own words: Why do some people think views on issues related to transgender people and those who donâ€™t identify as a man or a woman are changing too slowly? Discrimination â€œThere is far too much discrimination, hate, and violence directed toward people who are brave enough to stand up for who they truly are. We, as a country and as a society, need to respect how people want to identify themselves and be kind toward one another, end of story.â€ â€œProtections for basic rights to self-determination in identity, health care choices, privacy, and consensual relationships should be a bare minimum that our society can provide for everyone â€“ transgender people included.â€ â€œThereâ€™s too much discrimination. People need to quit controlling other peopleâ€™s private lives. I consider them very brave for having the courage to be who they identify with.â€ â€œEqual protection has not kept up with trans issues, including trans youth and the right to gender-affirming care.â€ Legislative efforts â€œAcceptance is not changing quick enough. There remains discrimination and elected officials are passing laws that make it more difficult for transgender individuals in society to live, work and exist.â€ â€œWe are going backwards with all the anti-gay &amp; -trans legislation that is being passed.â€ â€œFor every step forward, it feels like there are two steps back with reactive conservative laws.â€ â€œThese laws are working to restrict the rights of trans and nonbinary people, and also discrimination is still very high which results in elevated rates of suicide, poverty, violence and homelessness especially for people of color.â€ â€œThe spate of laws being proposed that would take away the rights of transgender people is evidence that weâ€™re a long way from treating them right.â€ Society is not open to change â€œToo many people are simply stuck in the binary. We, as a society, need to just accept that someone elseâ€™s gender identity is whatever they say it is and it rarely has any bearing on the lives of others.â€ â€œThese are people. Who they say they are is all that matters. Society, mostly conservatives, doesnâ€™t understand change in any form. So, they fight it. And they hinder the ability for others to learn about themselves and others, which slows growing as a society to a crawl.â€ â€œItâ€™s an issue that has been in the closet for centuries. Itâ€™s time to acknowledge and accept that gender identity is a spectrum and not binary.â€ â€œWe are not accepting the changes. We refuse to see what is in front of us. We care too much about not changing the status quo as we know it.â€ â€œSociety often views this as a phase or a period of uncertainty in their life. Instead, itâ€™s about a person bringing their gender identity in line with what they have experienced internally all their life.â€ Most say theyâ€™re not paying close attention to news about bills related to transgender people Chart showing Liberal Democrats are more likely than other groups to be following news about bills related to trans people closely Many states are considering legislation related to people who are transgender, but a relatively small share of U.S. adults (8%) say theyâ€™re following news about these bills extremely or very closely. Another 24% say theyâ€™re following this somewhat closely, while about two-thirds say theyâ€™re following it either a little closely (23%) or not all closely (44%).^3 Only about one-in-ten or less across age, racial and ethnic groups, and across levels of educational attainment, say they are following news about bills related to people who are transgender extremely or very closely. Six-in-ten or more across demographic groups say theyâ€™re following news about these bills a little closely or not closely at all. Liberal Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (46%) are more likely than moderate and conservative Democrats (29%) to say they are following news about state bills related to people who are transgender at least somewhat closely. Conservative Republicans and Republican leaners (31%) are more likely than their moderate and liberal counterparts (24%) â€“ but less likely than liberal Democrats â€“ to be following news about these bills at least somewhat closely. Still, half or more among each of these groups say they have been following news about this a little or not at all closely. About six-in-ten would favor requiring that transgender athletes compete on teams that match their sex at birth The survey asked respondents how they feel about some current laws and policies that are either in place or being considered across the U.S. related to transgender issues. Only two of seven items are either endorsed or rejected by a majority: 64% say they would favor policies that protect transgender individuals from discrimination in jobs, housing, and public spaces such as restaurants and stores, and 58% say they would favor policies that require that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth rather than the gender they identify with. Chart showing Most Americans say they would favor laws that would protect transgender people from discrimination in jobs, housing and public spaces Even though there is not a majority consensus on most of these laws or policies, there are gaps of at least 10 percentage points on three items. Some 46% say they would favor making it illegal for health care professionals to provide someone younger than 18 with medical care for gender transitions, and 41% would favor requiring transgender individuals to use public bathrooms that match the sex they were assigned at birth rather than the gender they identify with; 31% say they would oppose each of these. Meanwhile, more say they would oppose (44%) than say they would favor (27%) requiring health insurance companies to cover medical care for gender transitions. Views are more divided when it comes to laws and policies that would make it illegal for public school districts to teach about gender identity in elementary schools (41% favor and 38% oppose) or that would investigate parents for child abuse if they helped someone younger than 18 get medical care for a gender transition (37% favor and 36% oppose). Some 21% and 27%, respectively, say theyâ€™d neither favor nor oppose these policies. Views on many policies related to transgender issues vary by age, party, and race and ethnicity Majorities of U.S. adults across age groups express support for laws and policies that would protect transgender individuals from discrimination in jobs, housing, and public spaces such as restaurants and stores. About seven-in-ten adults ages 18 to 29 (70%) and 30 to 49 (68%) say they favor such protections, as do about six-in-ten adults ages 50 to 64 (60%) and 65 and older (59%). But adults younger than 30 are more likely than those in each of the older age groups to say they favor laws or policies that would require health insurance companies to cover medical care for gender transitions (37% among those younger than 30 vs. about a quarter among each of the older age groups). Theyâ€™re also less likely than older adults to express support for bills and policies that would restrict the rights of people who are transgender or limit what schools teach about gender identity. On most items, those ages 50 to 64 and those 65 and older express similar views. Chart showing Views of laws and policies related to transgender issues differ by age Views differ even more widely along party lines. For example, eight-in-ten Democrats say they favor laws or policies that would protect trans individuals from discrimination, compared with 48% of Republicans. Conversely, by margins of about 40 percentage points or more, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to express support for laws or policies that would do each of the following: require trans athletes to compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth (85% of Republicans vs. 37% of Democrats favor); make it illegal for health care professionals to provide someone younger than 18 with medical care for a gender transition (72% vs. 26%); make it illegal for public school districts to teach about gender identity in elementary schools (69% vs. 18%); require transgender individuals to use public bathrooms that match the sex they were assigned at birth (67% vs. 20%); and investigate parents for child abuse if they help someone younger than 18 get medical care for a gender transition (59% vs. 17%). Overall, White adults tend to be more likely than Black, Hispanic and Asian adults to express support for laws and policies that would restrict the rights of transgender people or limit what schools can teach about gender identity. But among Democrats, White adults are often less likely than other groups to favor such laws and policies, particularly compared with their Black and Hispanic counterparts. And White Democrats are more likely than Black, Hispanic and Asian Democrats to say they favor protecting trans individuals from discrimination and requiring health insurance companies to cover medical care for gender transitions. Sizable shares say forms and government documents should include options other than â€˜maleâ€™ and â€˜femaleâ€™ Chart showing About four-in-ten or more say forms and government documents should offer options other than â€˜maleâ€™ and â€˜femaleâ€™ About four-in-ten Americans (38%) say government documents such as passports and driverâ€™s licenses that ask about a personâ€™s gender should include options other than â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemaleâ€ for people who donâ€™t identify as either; a larger share (44%) say the same about forms and online profiles that ask about a personâ€™s gender. Half of adults younger than 30 say government documents that ask about gender should include options other than â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemale,â€ compared with 39% of those ages 30 to 49, 35% of those 50 to 64 and 33% of adults 65 and older. When it comes to forms and online profiles, 54% of adults younger than 30 and 47% of those ages 30 to 49 say these forms should include more than two gender options; smaller shares of adults ages 50 to 64 and 65 and older (37% each) say the same. Views on this vary considerably by party. A majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say forms and online profiles (64%) and government documents (58%) that ask about a personâ€™s gender should include options other than â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemale.â€ In contrast, about eight-in-ten or more Republicans and Republican leaners say forms and online profiles (79%) and government documents (83%) should not include more than these two gender options. Those who say they know someone who is nonbinary are more likely than those who donâ€™t know anyone whoâ€™s nonbinary to say forms and government documents should include gender options other than â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemale.â€ Still, 39% of those who donâ€™t know anyone whoâ€™s nonbinary say forms and online profiles shouldinclude other gender options, and 33% say the same about government documents that ask about a personâ€™s gender. Conversely, 31% of those who say they know someone whoâ€™s nonbinary say forms and online profiles should not include options other than â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemale,â€ and 41% say this about government documents. About three-in-ten parents of K-12 students say their children have learned about people who are trans or nonbinary at school In recent months, lawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that would prohibit or limit instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in schools. The survey asked parents of K-12 students whether any of their children have learned about people who are transgender or who donâ€™t identify as a boy or a girl from a teacher or another adult at their school and how they feel about the fact that their children have or have not learned about this. Some 37% of parents with children in middle or high school say their middle or high schoolers have learned about people who are transgender or who donâ€™t identify as a boy or a girl from a teacher or another adult at their school; a much smaller share of parents of elementary school students (16%) say the same. Overall, 29% of parents with children in elementary, middle or high school say at least one of their K-12 children have learned about this at school. Similar shares of parents of K-12 students in urban (31%), suburban (27%) and rural (32%) areas â€“ and in the Northeast (34%), Midwest (33%), South (26%) and West (28%) â€“ say their school-age children have learned about people who are transgender or who donâ€™t identify as a boy or a girl. And Republican (27%) and Democratic (31%) parents are also about equally likely to say their children have learned about this in school. None of these differences are statistically significant. Chart showing Views on children learning about people who are trans or nonbinary at school differ by party, childrenâ€™s age Many parents of K-12 students donâ€™t think itâ€™s good for their children to learn about people who are transgender or nonbinary from their teachers or other adults at school. Among parents of elementary school students, 45% either say their children have learned about people who are trans or nonbinary at school and see this is a bad thing or say their children have not learned about this and say this is a good thing. A far smaller share (13%) say itâ€™s a good thing that their elementary school children have learned about people who are trans or nonbinary or that itâ€™s a bad thing that they havenâ€™t learned about this. And about four-in-ten (41%) say itâ€™s neither good nor bad that their elementary school children have or havenâ€™t learned about people who are transgender or nonbinary. Among parents with children in middle or high school, 34% say itâ€™s a bad thing that their children have learned about people who are trans or nonbinary at school or that itâ€™s a good thing that they havenâ€™t; 14% say itâ€™s good that their middle or high schoolers have learned about this or that itâ€™s bad that they havenâ€™t; and 51% say itâ€™s neither good nor bad that their children have or havenâ€™t learned about this in school. Republican and Republican-leaning parents with children in elementary, middle and high school are more likely than their Democratic and Democratic-leaning counterparts to say itâ€™s a bad thing that their children have learned about people who are trans or nonbinary at school or that itâ€™s a good thing that they havenâ€™t. In turn, Democratic parents are more likely to say itâ€™s good that their children have learned about this or bad that they havenâ€™t. They are also more likely to say itâ€™s neither good nor bad that their children have or havenâ€™t learned about people who are trans or nonbinary at school.

Transgender is a less clinical term, referring more to gender identity and gender expression than to physical sex characteristics or sexual orientation. It is also a more general and inclusive term: a transgender person may be nonbinary, gender-fluid, genderqueer, third gender, etc. Use of transgender as a noun (One of my colleagues is a transgender ) is declining and is usually taken as offensive. And many people object to the adjectival variant transgendered (One of my colleagues is transgendered ) because the â€“ed suffix seems to imply that something happened to make the person transgender.

Blinken, Secretary of State November 20, 2023 Each year on November 20, the world recognizes Transgender Day of Remembrance â€“ a day to commemorate the transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming persons who are targeted and killed for living authentically and courageously. Trans individuals are a part of every country, every culture, and every faith tradition. The United States honors Transgender Day of Remembrance to affirm the humanity and human rights of transgender persons globally. Transgender persons experience disproportionately high levels of homicide and assault. Their families and loved ones too often see no justice. Countries around the world must ensure every hate crime is fully investigated. This year, we re-commit ourselves to ensuring acceptance and support for transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming persons. It is everyoneâ€™s responsibility to ensure trans persons can live full lives of dignity, without fear of violence or harm. Until then, we will continue to speak loudly and clearly to end transphobic violence and homicide.

While these issues may not apply to everyone, they are important for everyone and their health providers to consider. Barriers to Health Care Some transgender people may not consult health care services because they have had negative experiences with doctors in the past. For that reason, organizations such as theâ€¯World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)â€¯have created resources to help transgender people find knowledgeable, supportive, caring and compassionate providers in their communities. For the best care possible, people should feel empowered to take an active role in their health by: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Voicing concerns if something doesnâ€™t seem right. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Asking questions if they are unsure about any information. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Being forthcoming about any medications and past surgeries, as these may affect treatment plans and preventive care options. Transgender Violence Transgender and gender-expansive people face a disproportionately high risk of physical and sexual violence in our society, much of which is motivated by hate or fear, and stems from a lack of understanding and acceptance. This violence can be perpetrated by loved ones, family and friends, or strangers, and can occur in the home, school, workplace or on the street. Intimate Partner Violence Intimate partner violence (sometimes calledâ€¯domestic violence) involves physical or emotional harm by a significant other â€” usually a partner, spouse or date. Typically, intimate partner violence begins with verbal threats and can escalate to physical abuse. Early recognition is important and individuals can seek help as soon as possible. Intimate partner violence often involves manipulation and control. Some of the barriers faced by gender-expansive survivors of intimate partner violence include: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Access to support services. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Lack of training on the part of service providers. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Discrimination in shelters. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence has information on services and organizations that are inclusive and supportive of trans survivors. Research suggests that gender diverse people face intimate partner violence at much higher rates than other adults. However, victims may be hesitant to seek help because they fear discrimination from law enforcement and health care providers. Sadly, not all intimate partner violence resources accommodate transgender and gender-expansive people, but specific assistance is available in certain areas. Workplace Discrimination Twenty-six percent of transgender and gender-expansive adults report being fired because of their identity. Because gender diverse people face such extreme job discrimination, some may turn to sex work as a last resort. This puts them at far greater risk of physical and sexual violence. Make sure you know your rights as an employee. Sexual and Reproductive Health Fertility Options Some gender-expansive people aspire to have children or be parents. Because of this, all reproductive options and future plans, such as sperm banking, should be discussed with individuals before medical or surgical procedures that may reduce their future reproductive options. Additionally, itâ€™s important for gender-expansive people and their families to find a provider or center that understands their specific needs and offers services in a caring and compassionate environment. If you are interested in your fertility options, please consider discussing this during your intake interview with the Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health. The Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health Team at Johns Hopkins Embracing diversity and inclusion, the Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health provides affirming, objective, person-centered care to improve health and enhance wellness; educates interdisciplinary health care professionals to provide culturally competent, evidence-based care; informs the public on transgender health issues; and advances medical knowledge by conducting biomedical research. More about the Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health Preventive Care and Screenings Sexual and reproductive health concerns for trans people may not be addressed due to the perception that people who have had gender affirmation surgery may not require clinical Pap tests, breast exams or prostate cancer screening. These stereotypes and associated discrimination may make it uncomfortable for some gender-expansive people to access these important health care services. But while it may be unpleasant or even traumatic for some trans people to bring up these issues, early detection is essential for catching cancers while they are still treatable. With that in mind, it is imperative that all individuals with a uterus, cervix, breasts or a prostate gland be offered regular preventive and diagnostic screenings for those organs. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) Some transgender people are at greater risk for certainâ€¯STIs. Aside from abstinence, the best method to prevent STIs is to use barriers, such as external condoms, internal condoms or dental dams, with every sexual encounter. Fearing rejection or danger, trans people may not pressure their partners to use condoms â€” especially if sex work is involved or if the partner is violent. Barrier methods play an enormous role in STI prevention, so it is important for transgender and gender-expansive people to feel empowered to make safe sex decisions. There are a few sexually transmitted infections you should be aware of: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) HIVâ€¯ is a virus that can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) if left untreated. HIV impairs the immune systemâ€™s ability to fight infections and certain cancers. HIV is spread through direct contact with body fluids that contain the virus â€” often through needle sharing and anal, vaginal and (very rarely) oral sex. Knowing your HIV status is an important part of protecting yourself and others. Trans people at risk of HIV infection can talk with their health care provider about taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV. PrEP is a drug that, when combined with consistent condom use, can minimize HIV transmission. Ask your primary care clinician if PrEP is right for you. Syphilis Syphilis is a bacterial infection that causes small painless sores on your genitalia. It can harm the heart and nervous system if not treated in a timely manner. Syphilis is transmitted through oral, anal and vaginal sex. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection that causes painful urination and excessive discharge from the vagina or penis. It can lead to fertility complications if left untreated. Gonorrhea is passed between partners through oral, anal and vaginal sex. New, more drug-resistant strains are becoming increasingly common. It is important to be tested to ensure adequate treatment. Chlamydia Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that causes painful urination, excessive vaginal discharge, and sometimes testicular swelling. Often times there are no symptoms for the first few weeks. If left untreated, chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and long term pelvic pain. Chlamydia is passed between partners through oral, anal and vaginal sex. It is important to be tested and treated for chlamydia in a timely manner. Hepatitis A and B Hepatitis Aâ€¯andâ€¯hepatitis Bâ€¯are viral infections that cause damage to the liver. Hepatitis A is mostly spread through contaminated food but can also be spread through anal and oral sex. Hepatitis B is transmitted through needle sharing and anal, oral and vaginal sex. Hepatitis A infections usually clear on their own, but hepatitis B can cause permanent or chronic damage to the liver, resulting in liver cancer. Vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B are available, and transgender people should discuss them with their health care provider to ensure initial vaccinations and booster shots are received. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) HPV is a group of viruses that can cause genital warts and certain cancers. HPV is spread through oral, anal and vaginal sex. A vaccine may be able to protect some people from the forms of HPV that can lead to certain cancers. Other Infections Meningitis is most often spread through germs in coughs and sneezes, but can also be passed to others through close contact. People with compromised immune systems â€” for example, those living with HIV or AIDS â€” are especially at risk. People should talk to their health care providers about immunization against meningitis. Substance Use Disorder Gender-expansive people are more likely than the general population to drink alcohol and smoke, and these behaviors are often linked to the high levels of discrimination and lack of acceptance faced by trans individuals in our society. This is a very important health concern because the use of these substances is linked to substance use disorder, multiple forms of cancer and conditions of the heart and lungs. Among other dangerous health effects, tobacco use puts people at much higher risk for several cancers. It also contributes to wound healing complications if you decide to proceed with gender affirming surgery. Excessive alcohol use contributes to permanent liver damage and risky sexual behaviors. The use of illicit substances can increase risk for some of the infections listed above. Drug use or misuse use may also impair psychological stability and lead to further mental health problems. Trans people who do not have reliable access to hormones from their doctor may try to get them elsewhere. In proper doses, hormones are safe, but they should be prescribed and monitored by a physician to guard against dangerous side effects. Silicone Injections The use of unmonitored silicone injections is also a health concern for trans people who may be unable to access professional cosmetic surgery. These illegal injections often contain toxic ingredients and can lead to severe disfigurement and even death.

From the overturn of the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 to allowing trans athletes to compete in athletics, major strides have been made. However, these steps forward do not guarantee the protection of gay rights, as is demonstrated in the anit-queer legislation widely called the â€œDonâ€™t Say Gayâ€ bill. This bill has the potential to do significant harm to students, and may not be the most effective way to protect children from damaging content. Introduction The Parental Rights in Education Bill introduced by the Florida House of Representatives, commonly known as the â€œDonâ€™t Say Gayâ€ bill, â€˜prohibits classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in certain grade levels.â€™ The bill says that â€˜a school district may not encourage classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in primary grade levels or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.â€™ This language is vague, but implies that some content regarding gender identity and sexuality may be taught if it is deemed â€˜age-appropriateâ€™. This may allow teaching that actively opposes LGBTQ+ identities, and leads many to question whether the purpose of this bill is to protect children from â€˜ideologyâ€™, or if it is simply an attempt to embed conservative views about gender and sexuality in children early in their development. Also included in the bill are regulations that dictate that if a student is receiving resources at school for their mental or physical health, a parent must be notified. Supporters of the bill state that it will facilitate family discussions and allow parents to have more input in what is taught in schools, while opponents express that the bill will harm LGBTQ+ families and damage studentâ€™s rights. Pointed Summary aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls The Parental Rights in Education Bill limits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Concerns over the bill focus primarily on the potential harm it will do to LGBTQ+ students and families Current Stances The history of anti-gay legislation is extensive, and the Parental Rights in Education Bill has only been the latest addition. Anti-gay legislation is not confined to laws that mention LGBTQ+ individuals. Religious exemption laws provide citizens the opportunity to deny services to those who identify as LGBTQ+. After Elane Photography v. Willock, a 2013 New Mexico Supreme Court ruling that applied an anti-discrimination law when a photography business refused to photograph a same-sex wedding, Arizonaâ€™s Senate enacted Bill 1062 stating that â€œstate action shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.â€ Similar laws have been passed, such as the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, stating that "the word 'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife,â€ denying recognition and rights for same-sex couples. Tried Policy Many legislators have plans to institute the Parental Rights in Education bill outside of Florida, in states such as Georgia and Louisiana. Similar legislation has been enacted in different states in recent years, restricting discussions and history about LGBTQ+ identities and issues. In Tennessee, the House introduced a bill banning materials that â€œpromote, normalize, support, or address lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) lifestylesâ€ in K-12 schools. Another in Kansas, House Bill No. 2662 labels â€œhomosexualityâ€ as a Class B misdemeanor in schools. Policy Questions Problem Stakeholders Most obviously, this bill will affect students, as it removes discourse around certain topics from their classrooms, and enforces disclosure of information around their mental and physical health to parents. Parents are another stakeholder, as the bill seeks to â€˜reinforce the fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their childrenâ€™. Some parents may want more control over what their children are taught, and specifically that it conforms to their own beliefs. The bill will also affect teachers and schools, who will be under a set of enforceable obligations regarding what they can and cannot tell children, and may face legal consequences if they get it wrong. Risks of Indifference The bill requires that parents are informed of and involved in â€˜critical decisions affecting student's mental, emotional, or physical well-beingâ€™, as well as to notify parents of â€˜healthcare servicesâ€™. There is concern that children of parents hostile to their potential gender identity or sexual orientation will be â€˜outedâ€™ to their parents as soon as they begin to ask these questions, and face degrading and harmful treatment such as conversion therapies. Nonpartisan Reasoning Those in favor of the bill argue that it helps to address the problem of removing what they view as progressive ideology from the classroom. They argue that young children should not be exposed to views around sex and gender. Governor De Santis, a proponent of the bill, argues â€˜First graders should not have woke gender ideology [sic] imposed in their curriculum, and that is what we are standing for.â€™ The Senator supporting the bill also says that the bill serves to address â€˜social engineering that could result in more children identifying as gay or transgender.â€™ These speak to a widespread belief that children are being corrupted by learning about progressive views on sex and gender. When signing the bill, DeSantis said â€˜We will make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination.â€™ The bill claims to â€˜reinforce (the) fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding upbringing &amp; control of their childrenâ€™, allowing parents to sue schools if they feel the provisions of the bill have been breached. For those in favor of the bill, this provides parents with more of a say in their childrensâ€™ upbringing, allowing them to shield their children from material they view as harmful, and to raise their children as they see fit. However, removing this content from classrooms may do more harm than good. Campaigners against the bill argue that removing access to information about gender and sexuality is likely to harm children by not providing them with the support they need if they begin to question aspects of their identity. LGBTQ+ children already face high suicide rates, discrimination and abuse, and alienating them from discussion about their identities from the outset may compound the ostracisation and mental health difficulties they face. It may also lead these children to turn to other sources for information, such as the internet, which can lead them to explore content far beyond their age level, and also to potentially harmful information about their own identity. More than just erasing progressive notions of gender and sexuality, Brandon Wolf, press secretary of LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Florida, argues that the bill may further stigmatize LGBTQ+ students. He said â€˜suggesting sexual orientation or gender identity is â€˜contagiousâ€™ is not based in fact.â€™ As well as stigmatizing these students socially, it may cause them internal harm too. As mentioned above, the vague language of the bill, such as the â€˜age-appropriateâ€™ teaching provision, suggests that children will be taught content that actively reinforces conservative views on gender, sexuality, and the family. This may cause students to internalize these notions, leading to mental health issues if they do come to question their own identities. Finally, there is also a concern that teachers will be placed in difficult positions. When students come to them to ask questions relating to their sexuality or gender, teachers will be legally obliged to give answers that, as demonstrated above, may be harmful to these childrensâ€™ development. Furthermore, these teachers are at risk of being sued by parents for not disclosing these conversations, even if they fear the children would be placed at risk should their conversations be revealed to schools and parents. This removes the ability of schools to care for their students. Whilst some may celebrate this, arguing that schools should not raise their children, others are concerned that this will leave children vulnerable and without a sufficient level of care. Policy Options The policy of Floridaâ€™s Parental Rights in Education billâ€”also referred to as the â€œDonâ€™t Say Gayâ€ billâ€” is vague, with the implementation beginning with â€œnotifying a studentâ€™s parentâ€ when their child is receiving mental health services. Additionally, parents could â€œbring action against the school districtâ€¦and seek injunctive reliefâ€ if the school district does not enforce the new bill, with the court awarding damages and â€œreasonable attorney fees and court costsâ€ to the parent, at the school districtâ€™s expense. The cost to the government is minimal, as the schools themselves would incur the costs of the lawsuits brought forth if the parents were awarded damages. But schools already struggling for funding may find lawsuits very difficult to fund, potentially compromising the quality of education they provide. Governor Ron DeSantis signed the bill into law on March 28th, scheduled to be implemented on July 1st. Conclusion Floridaâ€™s â€˜Donâ€™t Say Gayâ€™ bill is the latest installment in the USâ€™ so called â€˜culture warsâ€™. Proponents believe it will protect their children from â€˜woke gender ideologyâ€™, preventing an â€˜indoctrinationâ€™ in ideas that gender is socially constructed, or that divergence from heterosexuality is acceptable and normal. They argue it will return control to parents over how their children are raised, and what they are taught. Advocates hope it will prevent their children from questioning gender and sexuality norms, divergence from which many of these proponents view as morally wrong. Those against the bill argue that it is nothing more than a reactionary moral panic against progressive social ideas, and will cause significant harm to many children. There is concern that removing open discussion on these issues will lead children contemplating their identities to more harmful content on the internet, to ostracize them from their peers, and to internalize conceptions of themselves as wrong or prohibited, leading to mental health issues. The vague language of the bill suggests teaching contrary to liberal progressive ideas will be allowed, which may further compound mental health problems. The privacy provisions of the bill may put students at risk, and limit the abilities of teachers to care for children and schools to provide good education.

trans) is someone whose gender identity differs from that typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth.^[1] Some transgender people who desire medical assistance to transition from one sex to another identify as transsexual.^[2]^[3] Transgender is an umbrella term; in addition to including people whose gender identity is the opposite of their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may also include people who are non-binary or genderqueer.^[4]^[5]^[6] Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or else conceptualize transgender people as a third gender.^[7]^[8] The term transgender may be defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.^[9] Being transgender is distinct from sexual orientation.^[10] Transgender people may identify as heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay or lesbian), bisexual, asexual, or otherwise, or may decline to label their sexual orientation. The opposite of transgender is cisgender, which describes persons whose gender identity matches their assigned sex.^[11] Accurate statistics on the number of transgender people vary widely,^[12] in part due to different definitions of what constitutes being transgender.^[13] Some countries, such as Canada, collect census data on transgender people.^[14] Generally, fewer than 1% of the worldwide population are transgender, with figures ranging from &lt;0.1% to 0.6%.^[15]^[16]^[17] The degree to which individuals feel genuine, authentic, and comfortable within their external appearance and accept their genuine identity has been called gender congruence.^[18] Many transgender people experience gender dysphoria, and some seek medical treatments such as hormone replacement therapy, sex reassignment surgery, or psychotherapy.^[19] Not all transgender people desire these treatments, and some cannot undergo them for financial or medical reasons.^[19]^[20] Many transgender people face discrimination in the workplace^[21] and in accessing public accommodations^[22] and healthcare.^[23] In many places, they are not legally protected from discrimination.^[24] [220px-2017.05.13_-HeroesGala2017_Capital_Pride_Washington_DC%2C_USA_48 54_%2834519692261%29.jpg_%28cropped%29.jpg] Transgender friends in Washington, D.C.^[25]^[26] Terminology Before the mid-20th century various terms were used within and beyond Western medical and psychological sciences to identify persons and identities labeled transsexual, and later transgender from mid-century onward.^[5]^[27] Imported from the German and ultimately modeled after German Transsexualismus (coined in 1923),^[28] the English term transsexual has enjoyed international acceptability, though transgender has been increasingly preferred over transsexual.^[29] The word transgender acquired its modern umbrella term meaning in the 1990s.^[30]^[31] Transgender Psychiatrist John F. Oliven of Columbia University used the term transgenderism in his 1965 reference work Sexual Hygiene and Pathology,^[32]^[33]^[34] writing that the term which had previously been used, transsexualism, "is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism' is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism."^[35]^[36] The term transgender was then popularized with varying definitions by various transgender, transsexual, and transvestite people, including Virginia Prince,^[2] who used transgenderal^[37] in the December 1969 issue of Transvestia, a national magazine for cross-dressers she founded.^[38] By the mid-1970s both trans-gender and trans people were in use as umbrella terms,^[note 1] while transgenderist and transgenderal were used to refer to people who wanted to live cross-gender without sex reassignment surgery (SRS).^[39] By 1976, transgenderist was abbreviated as TG in educational materials.^[40]^[verification needed] By 1984, the concept of a "transgender community" had developed, in which transgender was used as an umbrella term.^[41] In 1985, Richard Elkins established the "Trans-Gender Archive" at the University of Ulster.^[38] By 1992, the International Conference on Transgender Law and Employment Policy defined transgender as an expansive umbrella term including "transsexuals, transgenderists, cross dressers", and anyone transitioning.^[42] Leslie Feinberg's pamphlet, "Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time has Come", circulated in 1992, identified transgender as a term to unify all forms of gender nonconformity; in this way transgender has become synonymous with queer.^[43] In 1994, gender theorist Susan Stryker defined transgender as encompassing "all identities or practices that cross over, cut across, move between, or otherwise queer socially constructed sex/gender boundaries", including, but not limited to, "transsexuality, heterosexual transvestism, gay drag, butch lesbianism, and such non-European identities as the Native American berdache or the Indian Hijra".^[44] Between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s, the primary terms used under the transgender umbrella were "female to male" (FtM) for men who transitioned from female to male, and "male to female" (MtF) for women who transitioned from male to female. These terms have been superseded by "trans man" and "trans woman", respectively.^[45] This shift in preference from terms highlighting biological sex ("transsexual", "FtM") to terms highlighting gender identity and expression ("transgender", "trans man") reflects a broader shift in the understanding of transgender people's sense of self and the increasing recognition of those who decline medical reassignment as part of the transgender community.^[45] Transgender can also refer specifically to a person whose gender identity is opposite (rather than different from) the sex the person had or was identified as having at birth.^[46]^[47]^[48]^[49] Transfeminine is a term for any person, binary or non-binary, who was assigned male at birth and has a predominantly feminine gender identity or presentation.^[50] Transmasculine refers to a person assigned female at birth who has a predominantly masculine gender identity or presentation.^[50] Transgendered is a common term in older literature. Many within the transgender community deprecate it on the basis that transgender is an adjective, not a verb.^[51] Organizations such as GLAAD and The Guardian also state that transgender should never be used as a noun (e.g., "Max is transgender" or "Max is a transgender man", not "Max is a transgender").^[5]^[52] "Transgender" is also a noun for the broader topic of transgender identity and experience.^[53] Although the term "transgenderism" was once considered acceptable, it has come to be viewed as offensive, according to GLAAD.^[54] In 2020 the International Journal of Transgenderism changed its name to the International Journal of Transgender Health "to reflect a change toward more appropriate and acceptable use of language in our field."^[55] Health-practitioner manuals, professional journalistic style guides, and LGBT advocacy groups advise the adoption by others of the name and pronouns identified by the person in question, including present references to the transgender person's past.^[56]^[57] In contrast, people whose sense of personal identity corresponds to the sex and gender assigned to them at birth â€“ that is, those who are neither transgender nor non-binary or genderqueer â€“ are called cisgender.^[58] Transsexual See also: Transsexual Terminology Inspired by Magnus Hirschfeld's 1923 term seelischer Transsexualismus, the term transsexual was introduced to English in 1949 by David Oliver Cauldwell^[note 2] and popularized by Harry Benjamin in 1966, around the same time transgender was coined and began to be popularized.^[2] Since the 1990s, transsexual has generally been used to refer to the subset of transgender people^[2]^[59]^[60] who desire to transition permanently to the gender with which they identify and who seek medical assistance (for example, sex reassignment surgery) with this. Distinctions between the terms transgender and transsexual are commonly based on distinctions between gender and sex.^[61]^[62] Transsexuality may be said to deal more with physical aspects of one's sex, while transgender considerations deal more with one's psychological gender disposition or predisposition, as well as the related social expectations that may accompany a given gender role.^[63] Many transgender people reject the term transsexual.^[3]^[64]^[5] Christine Jorgensen publicly rejected transsexual in 1979 and instead identified herself in newsprint as trans-gender, saying, "gender doesn't have to do with bed partners, it has to do with identity."^[65]^[66] Some have objected to the term transsexual on the basis that it describes a condition related to gender identity rather than sexuality.^[67]^[better source needed]^[note 3]^[failed verification] Some transsexual people object to being included in the transgender umbrella.^[68]^[69]^[70] In his 2007 book Imagining Transgender: An Ethnography of a Category, anthropologist David Valentine asserts that transgender was coined and used by activists to include many people who do not necessarily identify with the term and states that people who do not identify with the term transgender should not be included in the transgender spectrum.^[68] Leslie Feinberg likewise asserts that transgender is not a self-identifier (for some people) but a category imposed by observers to understand other people.^[69] According to the Transgender Health Program (THP) at Fenway Health in Boston, there are no universally-accepted definitions, and confusion is common because terms that were popular at the turn of the 21st century may have since been deemed offensive. The THP recommends that clinicians ask clients what terminology they prefer, and avoid the term transsexual unless they are sure that a client is comfortable with it.^[67]^[undue weight? â€“ discuss] Harry Benjamin invented a classification system for transsexuals and transvestites, called the Sex Orientation Scale (SOS), in which he assigned transsexuals and transvestites to one of six categories based on their reasons for cross-dressing and the relative urgency of their need (if any) for sex reassignment surgery.^[71] Contemporary views on gender identity and classification differ markedly from Harry Benjamin's original opinions.^[72] Sexual orientation is no longer regarded as a criterion for diagnosis, or for distinction between transsexuality, transvestism and other forms of gender-variant behavior and expression. Benjamin's scale was designed for use with heterosexual trans women, and trans men's identities do not align with its categories.^[73] Sexual orientation Main article: Transgender sexuality Gender, gender identity, and being transgender are distinct concepts from sexual orientation.^[74] Sexual orientation is an individual's enduring pattern of attraction, or lack thereof, to others (being straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, etc.), whereas gender identity is a person's innate knowledge of their own gender (being a man, woman, non-binary, etc.).^[54] Transgender people can have any orientation, and generally use labels corresponding to their gender, rather than assigned sex at birth. For example, trans women who are exclusively attracted to other women commonly identify as lesbians, and trans men exclusively attracted to women would identify as straight.^[54] Many trans people describe their sexual orientation as queer, in addition to or instead of, other terms.^[75]^[76]^[77] For much of the 20th century, transgender identity was conflated with homosexuality and transvestism.^[78]^[79] In earlier academic literature, sexologists used the labels homosexual and heterosexual transsexual to categorize transgender individuals' sexual orientation based on their birth sex.^[80] Critics consider these terms "heterosexist",^[81] "archaic",^[82] and demeaning.^[83] Newer literature often uses terms such as attracted to men (androphilic), attracted to women (gynephilic), attracted to both (bisexual), or attracted to neither (asexual) to describe a person's sexual orientation without reference to their gender identity.^[84] Therapists are coming to understand the necessity of using terms with respect to their clients' gender identities and preferences.^[85] The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey reported that of the 27,715 transgender and non-binary respondents, 21% said queer best described their sexual orientation, 18% said pansexual, 16% said gay, lesbian, or same-gender-loving, 15% said straight, 14% said bisexual, and 10% said asexual.^[76] A 2019 Canadian survey of 2,873 trans and non-binary people found that 51% described their sexual orientation as queer, 13% as asexual, 28% as bisexual, 13% as gay, 15% as lesbian, 31% as pansexual, 8% as straight or heterosexual, 4% as two-spirit, and 9% as unsure or questioning.^[77] Related identities and practices Non-binary identity Main articles: Non-binary gender and Androgyny Some non-binary (or genderqueer) people identify as transgender. These identities are not specifically male or female. They can be agender, androgynous, bigender, pangender, or genderfluid,^[86] and exist outside of cisnormativity.^[87]^[88] Bigender and androgynous are overlapping categories; bigender individuals may identify as moving between male and female roles (genderfluid) or as being both masculine and feminine simultaneously (androgynous), and androgynes may similarly identify as beyond gender or genderless (agender), between genders (intergender), moving across genders (genderfluid), or simultaneously exhibiting multiple genders (pangender).^[89] Non-binary gender identities are independent of sexual orientation.^[90]^[91] Transvestism and cross-dressing Main article: Transvestism A transvestite is a person who cross-dresses, or dresses in clothes typically associated with the gender opposite the one they were assigned at birth.^[92]^[93] The term transvestite is used as a synonym for the term cross-dresser,^[94]^[95] although cross-dresser is generally considered the preferred term.^[95]^[96] The term cross-dresser is not exactly defined in the relevant literature. Michael A. Gilbert, professor at the Department of Philosophy, York University, Toronto, offers this definition: "[A cross-dresser] is a person who has an apparent gender identification with one sex, and who has and certainly has been birth-designated as belonging to [that] sex, but who wears the clothing of the opposite sex because it is that of the opposite sex."^[97] This definition excludes people "who wear opposite sex clothing for other reasons", such as "those female impersonators who look upon dressing as solely connected to their livelihood, actors undertaking roles, individual males and females enjoying a masquerade, and so on. These individuals are cross dressing but are not cross dressers."^[98] Cross-dressers may not identify with, want to be, or adopt the behaviors or practices of the opposite gender and generally do not want to change their bodies medically or surgically. The majority of cross-dressers identify as heterosexual.^[99] The term transvestite and the associated outdated term transvestism are conceptually different from the term transvestic fetishism, as transvestic fetishist refers to those who intermittently use clothing of the opposite gender for fetishistic purposes.^[100]^[101] In medical terms, transvestic fetishism is differentiated from cross-dressing by use of the separate codes 302.3 in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)^[101] and F65.1 in the ICD.^[100]^[needs update] Drag See also: Drag king, Drag queen, and Faux queen [220px-Victoria_Sin%2C_sandwich.jpg] A drag queen performer Drag is clothing and makeup worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons.^[102] Drag performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by second-wave feminism. Drag artists have a long tradition in LGBT culture. Generally the term drag queen covers men doing female drag, drag king covers women doing male drag, and faux queen covers women doing female drag.^[103]^[104] Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Drag performers are not inherently transgender. Some drag performers, transvestites, and people in the gay community have embraced the pornographically derived term tranny for drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing; this term is widely considered an offensive slur if applied to transgender people. History Main articles: Transgender history and Third gender A precise history of the global occurrence of transgender people is difficult to assess because the modern concept of being transgender, and of gender in general in relation to transgender identity, did not develop until the mid-1900s. Historical depictions, records and understandings are inherently filtered through modern principles, and were largely viewed through a medical and (often outsider) anthropological lens until the late 1900s.^[105]^[106] Some historians consider the Roman emperor Elagabalus to have been transgender. Elagabalus was reported to have dressed in a feminine manner, preferred to be called "Lady" instead of "Lord" and may have even sought a primitive form of gender-affirming surgery.^[107]^[108]^[109]^[110]^[111]^[excessive citations] Worldwide, a number of societies have had traditional third gender roles, some of which continue in some form into the present day.^[112]The Hippocratic Corpus (interpreting the writing of Herodotus) describes the "disease of the Scythians" (regarding the Enaree), which it attributes to impotency due to riding on a horse without stirrups. This reference was well discussed by medical writings of the 1500sâ€“1700s. Pierre Petit writing in 1596 viewed the "Scythian disease" as natural variation, but by the 1700s writers viewed it as a "melancholy", or "hysterical" psychiatric disease. By the early 1800s, being transgender separate from Hippocrates' idea of it was claimed to be widely known, but remained poorly documented. Both trans women and trans men were cited in European insane asylums of the early 1800s. One of the earliest recorded transgender people in America was Thomas(ine) Hall, a seventeenth century colonial servant.^[113] The most complete account of the time came from the life of the Chevalier d'Ã‰on (1728â€“1810), a French diplomat. As cross-dressing became more widespread in the late 1800s, discussion of transgender people increased greatly and writers attempted to explain the origins of being transgender. Much study came out of Germany, and was exported to other Western audiences. Cross-dressing was seen in a pragmatic light until the late 1800s; it had previously served a satirical or disguising purpose. But in the latter half of the 1800s, cross-dressing and being transgender became viewed as an increasing societal danger.^[105] William A. Hammond wrote an 1882 account of transgender Pueblo "shamans" [sic] (mujerados), comparing them to the Scythian disease. Other writers of the late 1700s and 1800s (including Hammond's associates in the American Neurological Association) had noted the widespread nature of transgender cultural practices among native peoples. Explanations varied, but authors generally did not ascribe native transgender practices to psychiatric causes, instead condemning the practices in a religious and moral sense. Native groups provided much study on the subject, and perhaps the majority of all study until after WWII.^[105] Critical studies first began to emerge in the late 1800s in Germany, with the works of Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfeld coined the term "transvestite" in 1910 as the scope of transgender study grew. His work would lead to the 1919 founding of the Institut fÃ¼r Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin. Though Hirscheld's legacy is disputed, he revolutionized the field of study. The Institut was destroyed when the Nazis seized power in 1933, and its research was infamously burned in the May 1933 Nazi book burnings.^[114] Transgender issues went largely out of the public eye until after World War II. Even when they re-emerged, they reflected a forensic psychology approach, unlike the more sexological that had been employed in the lost German research.^[105]^[115] Healthcare Main article: Transgender health care Further information: Gender transition Mental healthcare People who experience discord between their gender and the expectations of others or whose gender identity conflicts with their body may benefit by talking through their feelings in depth. While individuals may find counseling or psychotherapy helpful, it is no longer recommended as a prerequisite for further transition steps.^[116] Research on gender identity with regard to psychology, and scientific understanding of the phenomenon and its related issues, is relatively new.^[117]^[needs update?] The term gender incongruence is listed in the ICD by the WHO. In the American (DSM), the term gender dysphoria is listed under code F64.0 for adolescents and adults, and F64.2 for children.^[118] (Further information: Causes of gender incongruence.) France removed gender identity disorder as a diagnosis by decree in 2010,^[119]^[120] but according to French trans rights organizations, beyond the impact of the announcement itself, nothing changed.^[121] In 2017, the Danish parliament abolished the F64 Gender identity disorders. The DSM-5 refers to the topic as gender dysphoria (GD) while reinforcing the idea that being transgender is not considered a mental illness.^[122] Transgender people may meet the criteria for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria "only if [being transgender] causes distress or disability."^[123] This distress may manifest as depression or inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that all transgender people suffer from GD, which has confused transgender people and those who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing inner frustration or impairing their functioning do not suffer from GD. Moreover, GD is not necessarily permanent and is often resolved through therapy or transitioning. Feeling oppressed by the negative attitudes and behaviours of such others as legal entities does not indicate GD. GD does not imply an opinion of immorality; the psychological establishment holds that people with any kind of mental or emotional problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GD is whatever will alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this solution often, but not always, consists of undergoing a gender transition.^[117] Clinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this population of individuals.^[124] Many mental healthcare providers know little about transgender issues. Those who seek help from these professionals often educate the professional without receiving help.^[117] This solution usually is good for transsexual people but is not the solution for other transgender people, particularly non-binary people who lack an exclusively male or female identity. Instead, therapists can support their clients in whatever steps they choose to take to transition or can support their decision not to transition while also addressing their clients' sense of congruence between gender identity and appearance.^[18] Research on the specific problems faced by the transgender community in mental health has focused on diagnosis and clinicians' experiences instead of transgender clients' experiences.^[125] Therapy was not always sought by transgender people due to mental health needs. Prior to the seventh version of the Standards of Care (SOC), an individual had to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder in order to proceed with hormone treatments or sexual reassignment surgery. The new version decreased the focus on diagnosis and instead emphasized the importance of flexibility in order to meet the diverse health care needs of transsexual, transgender, and all gender-nonconforming people.^[126] The reasons for seeking mental health services vary according to the individual. A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of dealing with stigma and experiencing transphobia pushes many transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life, as one trans woman reflected: "Transgendered individuals are going to come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do, specifically, with being transgendered. It has to do because they've had to hide, they've had to lie, and they've felt all of this guilt and shame, unfortunately usually for years!"^[125] Many transgender people also seek mental health treatment for depression and anxiety caused by the stigma attached to being transgender, and some transgender people have stressed the importance of acknowledging their gender identity with a therapist in order to discuss other quality-of-life issues.^[125] Rarely, some choose to detransition.^[127] Problems still remain surrounding misinformation about transgender issues that hurt transgender people's mental health experiences. One trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training: "Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe that's it. I don't think I've had any formal training just going through [clinical] programs ... I don't think most [therapists] know. Most therapists â€“ Master's degree, PhD level â€“ they've had ... one diversity class on GLBT issues. One class out of the huge diversity training. One class. And it was probably mostly about gay lifestyle."^[125] Many health insurance policies do not cover treatment associated with gender transition, and numerous people are under- or uninsured, which raises concerns about the insufficient training most therapists receive prior to working with transgender clients, potentially increasing financial strain on clients without providing the treatment they need.^[125] Many clinicians who work with transgender clients only receive mediocre training on gender identity, but introductory training on interacting with transgender people has recently been made available to health care professionals to help remove barriers and increase the level of service for the transgender population.^[128] In February 2010, France became the first country in the world to remove transgender identity from the list of mental diseases.^[129]^[130] A 2014 study carried out by the Williams Institute (a UCLA think tank) found that 41% of transgender people had attempted suicide, with the rate being higher among people who experienced discrimination in access to housing or healthcare, harassment, physical or sexual assault, or rejection by family.^[131] A 2019 follow-up study found that transgender people who wanted and received gender-affirming medical care had substantially lower rates of suicidal thoughts and attempts.^[132] However, a study on the impact of parental support on trans youth found that among trans children with supportive parents, only 4% attempted suicide, a 93% decrease.^[133] Autism is more common in people who are gender dysphoric. It is not known whether there is a biological basis. This may be due to the fact that people on the autism spectrum are less concerned with societal disapproval, and feel less fear or inhibition about coming out as trans than others.^[134]^[better source needed] Physical healthcare Medical and surgical procedures exist for transsexual and some transgender people, though most categories of transgender people as described above are not known for seeking the following treatments. Hormone replacement therapy for trans men induces beard growth and masculinizes skin, hair, voice, and fat distribution. Hormone replacement therapy for trans women feminizes fat distribution and breasts, as well as diminishes muscle mass and strength. Laser hair removal or electrolysis removes excess hair for trans women. Surgical procedures for trans women feminize the voice, skin, face, Adam's apple, breasts, waist, buttocks, and genitals. Surgical procedures for trans men masculinize the chest and genitals and remove the womb, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. The acronyms "Gender-affirming surgery (GAS)" and "sex reassignment surgery" (SRS) refer to genital surgery. The term "sex reassignment therapy" (SRT) is used as an umbrella term for physical procedures required for transition. Use of the term "sex change" has been criticized for its emphasis on surgery, and the term "transition" is preferred.^[5]^[135] Availability of these procedures depends on degree of gender dysphoria, presence or absence of gender identity disorder,^[136] and standards of care in the relevant jurisdiction. Trans men who have not had a hysterectomy and who take testosterone are at increased risk for endometrial cancer because androstenedione, which is made from testosterone in the body, can be converted into estrogen, and external estrogen is a risk factor for endometrial cancer.^[137] Detransition Main article: Detransition Detransition refers to the cessation or reversal of a sex reassignment surgery or gender transition. Formal studies of detransition have been few in number,^[138] of disputed quality,^[139] and politically controversial.^[140] Estimates of the rate at which detransitioning occurs vary from less than 1% to as high as 13%.^[141] Those who undergo sex reassignment surgery have very low rates of detransition or regret.^[127]^[142]^[143]^[144] The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, with responses from 27,715 individuals who identified as "transgender, trans, genderqueer, [or] non-binary", found that 8% of respondents reported some kind of detransition. "Most of those who de-transitioned did so only temporarily: 62% of those who had de-transitioned reported that they were currently living full time in a gender different than the gender they were thought to be at birth."^[76] Detransition was associated with assigned male sex at birth, nonbinary gender identity, and bisexual orientation, among other cohorts.^[143] Only 5% of detransitioners (or 0.4% of total respondents) reported doing so because gender transition was "not for them"; 82% cited external reason(s), including pressure from others, the difficulties of transition, and discrimination. "The most common reason cited for de-transitioning was pressure from a parent (36%)."^[145]^[146]^[76] Law [170px-Camille_Cabral_pour_les_Trans.JPG] Camille Cabral, a French transgender activist at a demonstration for transgender people in Paris, October 1, 2005 Main article: Transgender rights Further information: Legal recognition of non-binary gender Legal procedures exist in some jurisdictions which allow individuals to change their legal gender or name to reflect their gender identity. Requirements for these procedures vary from an explicit formal diagnosis of transsexualism, to a diagnosis of gender identity disorder, to a letter from a physician that attests the individual's gender transition or having established a different gender role.^[147] In 1994, the DSM IV entry was changed from "Transsexual" to "Gender Identity Disorder". In 2013, the DSM V removed "Gender Identity Disorder" and published "Gender Dysphoria" in its place.^[148] In many places, transgender people are not legally protected from discrimination in the workplace or in public accommodations.^[24] A report released in February 2011 found that 90% of transgender people faced discrimination at work and were unemployed at double the rate of the general population,^[22] and over half had been harassed or turned away when attempting to access public services.^[22] Members of the transgender community also encounter high levels of discrimination in health care.^[149] Europe A Welsh Government advisory video on transgender hate crimes 36 countries in Europe require a mental health diagnosis for legal gender recognition and 20 countries require sterilisation.^[150] In April 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that requiring sterilisation for legal gender recognition violates human rights.^[151] Canada Main article: Transgender rights in Canada Jurisdiction over legal classification of sex in Canada is assigned to the provinces and territories. This includes legal change of gender classification. On June 19, 2017, Bill C-16, having passed the legislative process in the House of Commons of Canada and the Senate of Canada, became law upon receiving Royal Assent, which put it into immediate force.^[152]^[153]^[154] The law updated the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code to include "gender identity and gender expression" as protected grounds from discrimination, hate publications and advocating transgender genocide. The bill also added "gender identity and expression" to the list of aggravating factors in sentencing, where the accused commits a criminal offence against an individual because of those personal characteristics. Similar transgender laws also exist in all the provinces and territories.^[155] United States Main article: Transgender rights in the United States In the United States, transgender people are protected from employment discrimination by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Exceptions apply to certain types of employers, for example, employers with fewer than 15 employees and religious organizations.^[156] In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that Title VII prohibits discrimination against transgender people in the case R.G. &amp; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.^[157] Nicole Maines, a trans girl, took a case to Maine's supreme court in June 2013. She argued that being denied access to her high school's women's restroom was a violation of Maine's Human Rights Act; one state judge has disagreed with her,^[158] but Maines won her lawsuit against the Orono school district in January 2014 before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.^[159] On May 14, 2016, the United States Department of Education and Department of Justice issued guidance directing public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender identities.^[160] On June 30, 2016, the United States Department of Defense removed the ban that prohibited transgender people from openly serving in the US military.^[161] On July 27, 2017, President Donald Trump tweeted that transgender Americans would not be allowed to serve "in any capacity" in the United States Armed Forces.^[162] Later that day, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford announced, "there will be no modifications to the current policy until the president's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the secretary has issued implementation guidance."^[163] Joe Biden later reversed Trump's policy when he became president in 2021.^[164]^[165] India Main article: LGBT rights in India Transgender rights [220px-Jogappas_at_Bangalore.jpg] Jogappa is a transgender community in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

In April 2014, the Supreme Court of India declared transgender to be a 'third gender' in Indian law.^[166]^[167]^[168] The transgender community in India (made up of Hijras and others) has a long history in India and in Hindu mythology.^[169]^[170] Justice KS Radhakrishnan noted in his decision that, "Seldom, our society realizes or cares to realize the trauma, agony and pain which the members of Transgender community undergo, nor appreciates the innate feelings of the members of the Transgender community, especially of those whose mind and body disown their biological sex".^[171] Hijras have faced structural discrimination including not being able to obtain driving licenses, and being prohibited from accessing various social benefits. It is also common for them to be banished from communities.^[172] Sociocultural relationships [icon] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2023) LGBT community See also: LGBT, LGBT community, and LGBT culture Transgender culture Despite the distinction between sexual orientation and gender, throughout history gay, lesbian and bisexual subcultures were often the only places where gender-variant people were socially accepted in the gender role they felt they belonged to; especially during the time when legal or medical transitioning was almost impossible. This acceptance has had a complex history. Like the wider world, the gay community in Western societies did not generally distinguish between sex and gender identity until the 1970s, and the role of the transgender community in the history of LGBT rights is often overlooked.^[173] According to a study done at University of California, Los Angeles in 2011, conducted in part by Gary J. Gates, 3.5% of adults across the United States identify as either gay, lesbian, or bisexuals whereas only 0.3% of adults identify as transgender.^[174] Transgender individuals have been part of various LGBT movements throughout history, with significant contributions dating back to the early days of the gay liberation movement.^[175] The LGBT community is not a monolithic group, and there are different modes of thought on who is a part of this diverse community. The changes that came with the Gay Liberation Movement and Civil Rights movement saw many gay, lesbian, and bisexual people making headway within the public sphere, and gaining support from the wider public, throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. The trans community only experienced a similar surge in activism during the start of the twenty-first century.^[176]^[175] Due to the many different groups that make up the broader LGBT movement, there are those within the larger community who do not believe that the trans community has a place within the LGBT space.^[176]^[177] Religion Main article: Transgender people and religion The Vaticanâ€™s doctrine department has issued a recent ruling that allows Catholic baptism for transgender individuals and infants born to same-sex couples. Dated October 31, 2024, these new regulations stem from questions submitted by Brazilian bishop Giuseppe Negri to the dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF). The responses, addressing specific sacraments, were published on the Vaticanâ€™s website in Italy. Concerning transgender individuals, the document states that they can undergo baptism like any other adult, as long as there is no potential for causing scandal or disorientation among other Catholics. If children identifying as transgender are adequately prepared and willing, they can receive baptism, according to the document. Additionally, it mentions that transgender individuals, including those who have undergone gender reassignment, can serve as godparents and witnesses in Catholic weddings under appropriate conditions. The document also allows the baptism of children from same-sex couples, provided there is a well-founded hope that they will receive Catholic religious education. The document emphasizes that individuals in same-sex relationships are regarded as committing a sin, and baptism is conditional upon repentance for such actions. Several sermons by Pope Francis are referenced in the document to support this ruling.^[178] The Church of England passed a motion at the 2017 General Synod, which would ensure Anglican churches accepted transgender people, even suggesting on their website that transgender people could be gifted a Bible with their new name inscribed to support them.^[179] Feminism Main articles: Feminist views on transgender topics and Transfeminism Feminist views on transgender women have changed over time, but have generally become more positive. Second-wave feminism saw numerous clashes opposed to transgender women, since they were not seen as "true" women, and as invading women-only spaces.^[180]^[181] Though second-wave feminism argued for the sex and gender distinction, some feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female transition abandoned or devalued female identity and that transgender people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes.^[182] By the emergence of third-wave feminism (around 1990), opinions had shifted to being more inclusive of both trans and gay identities.^[183]^[184] Fourth-wave feminism (starting around 2012) has been widely trans-inclusive, but trans-exclusive groups and ideas remain as a minority, though one that is especially prominent in the UK.^[185]^[183]^[186] Feminists who do not accept that trans women are women have been labeled "trans-exclusionary radical feminists" (TERFs) or gender-critical feminists by opponents.^[187]^[188] Discrimination and support See also: Transphobia Transgender individuals experience significant rates of employment discrimination. Approximately 90% of trans people have encountered some form of harassment or mistreatment in their workplace. Moreover, 47% have experienced some form of adverse employment outcome due to being transgender; of this figure, 44% were passed over for a job, 23% were denied a promotion, and 26% were terminated on the grounds that they were transgender.^[189] Studies in several cultures have found that cisgender women are more likely to be accepting of trans people than cisgender men.^[190]^[191]^[192]^[193] The start of the twenty-first century saw the rise in transgender activism and with it an increase in support.^[175] Within the United States, groups such as the Trevor Project have been serving the wider LGBT community including people who identify with the term transgender. The group offers support in the form of educational resources including research, advocacy, and crisis services.^[194] The American Civil Liberties Unions (ACLU) is another group that fights legal battles in support of many different groups including those in the trans community.^[195] Other groups within the United States specifically advocate for transgender rights. One of these groups directly related to transgender support is the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE), which is committed to advocating for policy changes that protect transgender people and promote equality. Through their research, education, and advocacy efforts, the NCTE works to address issues such as healthcare access, employment discrimination, and legal recognition for transgender individuals.^[196] One prominent organization within Europe is Transgender Europe (TGEU), a network of organizations and individuals committed to promoting equality and human rights for transgender people within European borders. TGEU works to challenge discrimination, improve transgender healthcare access, advocate for legal recognition of gender identity, and support the well-being of transgender communities.^[197] Population figures and prevalence See also: Transsexual Prevalence Little is known about the prevalence of transgender people in the general population and reported prevalence estimates are greatly affected by variable definitions of transgender.^[198] According to a recent systematic review, an estimated 9.2 out of every 100,000 people have received or requested gender affirmation surgery or transgender hormone therapy; 6.8 out of every 100,000 people have received a transgender-specific diagnoses; and 355 out of every 100,000 people self-identify as transgender.^[198] These findings underscore the value of using consistent terminology related to studying the experience of transgender, as studies that explore surgical or hormonal gender affirmation therapy may or may not be connected with others that follow a diagnosis of "transsexualism", "gender identity disorder", or "gender dysphoria", none of which may relate with those that assess self-reported identity.^[198] Common terminology across studies does not yet exist, so population numbers may be inconsistent, depending on how they are being counted. A study in 2020 found that, since 1990, of those seeking sex hormone therapy for gender dysphoria there has been a steady increase in the percentage of trans men, such that they equal the number of trans women seeking this treatment.^[199] Asia [170px-Nongthoomfairtex.jpg] Nong Tum, a Kathoey internationally recognized for her portrayal in the film Beautiful Boxer In Thailand and Laos,^[200] the term kathoey is used to refer to male-to-female transgender people^[201] and effeminate gay men.^[202] However, many transgender people in Thailand do not identify as kathoey.^[203] Transgender people have also been documented in Iran,^[204] Japan,^[205] Nepal,^[206] Indonesia,^[207] Vietnam,^[208] South Korea,^[209] Jordan,^[210] Singapore,^[211] and the greater Chinese region, including Hong Kong,^[212]^[213] Taiwan,^[214] and the People's Republic of China.^[215]^[216] The cultures of the Indian subcontinent include a third gender, referred to as hijra in Hindi. In India, the Supreme Court on April 15, 2014, recognized a third gender that is neither male nor female, stating "Recognition of transgenders as a third gender is not a social or medical issue but a human rights issue."^[217] In 1998, Shabnam Mausi became the first transgender person to be elected in India, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.^[218] Europe According to Amnesty International, 1.5 million transgender people live in the European Union (as at 2017), making up 0.3% of the population.^[219] A 2011 survey conducted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in the UK found that of 10,026 respondents, 1.4% would be classified into a gender minority group. The survey also showed that 1% had gone through any part of a gender reassignment process (including thoughts or actions).^[220] In the England and Wales section of the 2021 United Kingdom census, 0.5% of respondents aged 16 and over indicated that their gender identity was different from their sex assigned at birth.^[221] North America The 2021 Canadian census released by Statistics Canada found that 59,460 Canadians (0.19% of the population) identified as transgender.^[222] According to the Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces by Statistics Canada in 2018, 0.24% of the Canadian population identified as transgender men, women or non-binary individuals.^[223] The Social Security Administration has tracked the sex of United States citizens since 1936.^[224] A 1968 estimate, by Ira B. Pauly, estimated that about 2,500 transsexual people were living in the United States, with four times as many trans women as trans men.^[225] One effort to quantify the modern population in 2011 gave a "rough estimate" that 0.3% of adults in the US are transgender.^[226]^[227] More recent studies released in 2016 estimate the proportion of Americans who identify as transgender at 0.5 to 0.6%. This would put the total number of transgender Americans at approximately 1.4 million adults (as of 2016^[update]).^[228]^[229]^[230]^[231] In the United States and Canada, some Native American and First Nations cultures traditionally recognize the existence of more than two genders,^[232] such as the Zuni male-bodied lhamana,^[233] the Lakota male-bodied winkte,^[234] and the Mohave male-bodied alyhaa and female-bodied hwamee.^[235] These traditional people, along with those from other North American Indigenous cultures, are sometimes part of the contemporary, pan-Indian two-spirit community.^[234] Historically, in most cultures who have alternate gender roles, if the spouse of a third gender person is not otherwise gender variant, they have not generally been regarded as other-gendered themselves, simply for being in a same-sex relationship.^[235] In Mexico, the Zapotec culture includes a third gender in the form of the Muxe.^[236] Mahu is a traditional third gender in Hawai'i and Tahiti. Mahu are valued as teachers, caretakers of culture, and healers, such as Kapaemahu. DinÃ© (Navajo) have NÃ¡dleehi.^[112] Latin America In Latin American cultures, a travesti is an individual who has been assigned male at birth and who has a feminine, transfeminine, or "femme" gender identity. Travestis generally undergo hormonal treatment, use female gender expression including new names and pronouns from the masculine ones they were given when assigned a sex, and might use breast implants, but they are not offered or do not desire sex-reassignment surgery. Travesti might be regarded as a gender in itself (a "third gender"), a mix between man and woman ("intergender/androgynes"), or the presence of both masculine and feminine identities in a single person ("bigender"). They are framed as something entirely separate from transgender women, who possess the same gender identity of people assigned female at birth.^[237] Other transgender identities are becoming more widely known, as a result of contact with other cultures of the Western world.^[238] These newer identities, sometimes known under the umbrella use of the term "genderqueer",^[238] along with the older travesti term, are known as non-binary and go along with binary transgender identities (those traditionally diagnosed under the obsolete label of "transsexualism") under the single umbrella of transgender, but are distinguished from cross-dressers and drag queens and kings, that are held as nonconforming gender expressions rather than transgender gender identities when a distinction is made.^[239] Culture Coming out Main article: Coming out Transgender people vary greatly in choosing when, whether, and how to disclose their transgender status to family, close friends, and others. The prevalence of discrimination and violence against transgender persons can make coming out a risky decision. Fear of retaliatory behavior, such as being removed from the parental home while underage, is a cause for transgender people to not come out to their families until they have reached adulthood.^[citation needed] Parental confusion and lack of acceptance of a transgender child may result in parents treating a newly revealed gender identity as a "phase" or making efforts to change their children back to "normal" by utilizing mental health services to alter the child's gender identity.^[240]^[better source needed] The internet can play a significant role in the coming out process for transgender people. Some come out in an online identity first, providing an opportunity to go through experiences virtually and safely before risking social sanctions in the real world.^[241] Visibility Main articles: Transgender Awareness Week, International Transgender Day of Visibility, and Transgender Day of Remembrance See also: Media portrayals of transgender people and Trans march [170px-Laverne_Cox_by_Sachyn_Mital.jpg] Actress Laverne Cox, who is trans, in July 2014 In 2014, the United States reached a "transgender tipping point", according to Time.^[242]^[243] At this time, the media visibility of transgender people reached a level higher than seen before. Since then, the number of transgender portrayals across TV platforms has stayed elevated.^[244] [220px-Existrans_2017_%2837146607344%29.jpg] Trans March "Existrans" 2017 Annual marches, protests or gatherings take place around the world for transgender issues, often taking place during the time of local Pride parades for LGBT people.

The holiday was founded by Michigan-based transgender activist^[251] Rachel Crandall in 2009.^[252] Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) is held every year on November 20 in honor of Rita Hester, who was killed on November 28, 1998. Her murder remains unsolved, but was described in 2022 as "a result of transphobia and anti-trans violence" by the Office of the Mayor of Boston, Michelle Wu.^[253] TDOR memorializes victims of hate crimes and prejudice and raises awareness of hate crimes committed upon living transgender people.^[254] Transgender Awareness Week is a one-week celebration leading up to TDOR, dedicated to educating about transgender and gender non-conforming people and the issues associated with their transition or identity.^[255] Pride symbols Main article: LGBT symbols Transgender See also: Transgender flag and Gendered associations of pink and blue A common symbol for the transgender community is the Transgender Pride Flag, which was designed by the American transgender woman Monica Helms in 1999, and was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona, in 2000. The flag consists of five horizontal stripes: light blue, pink, white, pink, and light blue^[256] Other transgender symbols include the butterfly (symbolizing transformation or metamorphosis),^[257] and a pink/light blue yin and yang symbol.^[258] Several gender symbols have been used to represent transgender people, including âš¥ and âš.^[259]^[260] See also aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls icon Transgender portal aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls LGBT portal Transgender at Wikipedia's sister projects aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Definitions from Wiktionary aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Media from Commons aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Quotations from Wikiquote aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Texts from Wikisource aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls List of transgender and transsexual fictional characters aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls List of transgender people aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls List of transgender publications aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls List of transgender-related topics aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls List of transgender-rights organizations aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls List of people killed for being transgender aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transgender history Notes 1. ^ aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls In April 1970, TV Guide published an article which referenced a post-operative transsexual movie character as being "transgendered."("Sunday Highlights".

Oliven writes: Where the compulsive urge reaches beyond female vestments, and becomes an urge for gender ('sex') change, transvestism becomes 'transsexualism.' The term is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism' is what is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism. Although Oliven's understanding of "transgender"is not the same as our understanding of it today, his use of it is still significant. As K.J. Rawson and Cristan Williams note in their book, "Transgender*: The Rhetorical Landscape of a Term," Oliven didn't use the word in the book's 1955 edition; it was added later, when the second edition was revised and published. Gradually, some members of this marginalized community began to apply the word "transgender"to themselves. For example, Virginia Charles Prince, publisher of the long-running periodical "Transvestia," occasionally used a variation of the word, "transgenderal."" 34. ^ Oliven, John F. (1965).

The term was chosen to provide an umbrella concept which avoided such medical categories as transsexual and transvestite; which included the widest possible range of transgender phenomena; and which took the sociological view that aspects of sex, sexuality and gender (not just gender), including the binary divide, all have socially constructed components.

Parental alienation (BUTTON) Traditional medicine Gender incongruence and transgender health in the ICD What is the ICD? The International Classification serves to record and report health and health-related conditions globally. ICD ensures interoperability of digital health data, and their comparability. The ICD contains diseases, disorders, health conditions and much more. The inclusion of a specific category into ICD depends on utility to the different uses of ICD and sufficient evidence that a health condition exists. ICD-11 and Gender Incongruence The 11^th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The newly revised ICD-11 codes includes new changes to reflect modern understanding of sexual health and gender identity. What does the ICD revision aim to do for transgender health? ICD-11 has redefined gender identity-related health, replacing outdated diagnostic categories like ICD-10â€™s â€œtranssexualismâ€ and â€œgender identity disorder of childrenâ€ with â€œgender incongruence of adolescence and adulthoodâ€ and â€œgender incongruence of childhoodâ€, respectively. Gender incongruence has been moved out of the â€œMental and behavioural disordersâ€ chapter and into the new â€œConditions related to sexual healthâ€ chapter. This reflects current knowledge that trans-related and gender diverse identities are not conditions of mental ill-health, and that classifying them as such can cause enormous stigma. Inclusion of gender incongruence in the ICD-11 should ensure transgender peopleâ€™s access to gender-affirming health care, as well as adequate health insurance coverage for such services. Recognition in the ICD also acknowledges the links between gender identity, sexual behaviour, exposure to violence and sexually transmitted infections. What is Gender Incongruence? The bulk of the changes centered around the moving of "gender incongruence" from a classification of mental health to one of sexual health. In 2020, we have a better understanding of the issues surrounding this condition, and they are not related to a mental health condition. Treating gender incongruence in a mental health chapter was causing additional stigma for an already stigmatized condition. WHO officials added the hope that adding this condition to a sexual health chapter of the ICD codes would "help increase access to care for health interventions" and "destigmatize the condition." What is transgender and what are the main health concerns of transgender people? Transgender people share many of the same health needs as the general population, but may have other specialist health-care needs, such as gender-affirming hormone therapy and surgery. However, evidence suggests that transgender people often experience a disproportionately high burden of disease, including in the domains of mental, sexual and reproductive health. Some transgender people seek medical or surgical transition, others do not. What is gender-affirmative health care? Gender-affirmative health care can include any single or combination of a number of social, psychological, behavioural or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and affirm an individualâ€™s gender identity. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Regions + Africa + Americas + Eastern Mediterranean + Europe + South-East Asia + Western Pacific aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Policies + Cyber security + Ethics + Permissions and licensing + Preventing sexual exploitation + Terms of use aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls About us + Careers + Library + Procurement + Publications + Frequently asked questions + Contact us Subscribe to our newsletters Home Privacy policy © 2023 WHO

Transgender Pride Flag [Originally published: March 15, 2022. Updated: March 21, 2022] An entire vocabulary has evolved around people who are transgender, and if youâ€™re not familiar with the latest terms, you can easily hurt someoneâ€™s feelings, even if thatâ€™s not your intention. Figuring out a personâ€™s terms can be challengingâ€”the lexicon includes words with meanings that have changed over time and could change again. And because each transgender person is navigating their own path, the best words to use in a conversation with them could vary depending on their circumstances. No one is expected to get this right at first, but you could make a huge difference to a transgender person by being knowledgeable and sensitive about language, says Christy Olezeski, PhD, director and co-founder of the Yale Pediatric Gender Program, which cares for transgender and nonbinary people up to the age of 25. "Itâ€™s really about respect," Olezeski says. â€œThis isnâ€™t anything new. Transgender and nonbinary people are everywhere.â€ Olezeski and other Yale Medicine experts who care for transgender patients weighed in on a short guide to understanding terms related to the transgender experience, especially if you are a doctor or a transgender patient. Which pronouns should you use? If you are not sure which name or pronouns a transgender person identifies with, you could introduce yourself and provide the pronouns you use to describe yourself. Then ask: â€œWhat is your name? Or what pronouns do you use?â€ Once you know, make sure to use their pronouns even when you are referring to an event that took place before they decided to make a transition. If you canâ€™t get confirmation, use â€œtheyâ€ as a singular pronoun when describing a transgender person. The bottom line is to avoid making assumptions about a personâ€™s gender or pronouns. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls He/Him/His and She/Her/Hers: These refer to the pronouns a person uses for themselves, whether or not they have made a transition. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls They and Them: These pronouns are considered third-person singular when used to refer to someone who doesnâ€™t fit the strict definitions of male or female. These can also be used as nonbinary pronouns for individuals who identify outside of the gender binary (defined below). aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Ze/Hir/Hirs: Pronouns that correspond with the traditional pronouns mentioned above (e.g., he/him/his, or she/her/hers). While not commonly used, they may be used to describe a person who doesnâ€™t identify within the gender binary. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Mx (pronounced "mix"): Used in place of Ms. or Mr. (People have used this term when they donâ€™t want to call attention to their gender, whether they are transgender or not.) Gender identity terms to know A personâ€™s gender identity reflects their deeply felt, internal sense of self as far as their gender, whether or not it aligns with the one assigned to them at birth. It applies to all people, transgender or not. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls LGBTQIA+: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and more. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender: Behavioral, cultural, and/or psychological ideas associated with a particular gender identity. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender binary: The idea that there are only two genders, male and female, and everyone must fall into one classification or the other. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Nonbinary: A person whose gender identity doesnâ€™t fit into the traditional gender binary structure of man or woman. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Agender: Adjective that describes someone who identifies as having no gender or who does not experience gender as a primary component of their identity. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Bigender: Adjective used to describe a person whose identity combines two genders or who may be sometimes male and sometimes female. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Cisgender: Adjective used to describe a person whose gender identity is congruent, in a traditional sense, with the sex assigned to them at birth. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Queer: An umbrella term for those who think of their gender identity or sexual orientation as being outside of societal norms. Once considered a derogatory term, â€œqueerâ€ has been reclaimed by many within the LGBTQIA+ community as a term of empowerment, but still may be considered offensive by some, especially if used by a person who is not in the community. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender expression: Ways of expressing and interpreting oneâ€™s gender through clothes, hairstyles, mannerisms, body modifications, or name. Gender expression varies, depending on culture, context, and historical period. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender affirmation: The process of making changes to recognize, accept, and express oneâ€™s gender identity. This might include any combination of social, legal, and/or medical changes that might range from changing oneâ€™s way of dressing and hairstyle, to having gender-affirming surgery, to changing oneâ€™s name and sex designation on legal documents. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transgender (sometimes shortened to â€œtransâ€): Describes the full range of people who identify with a different gender than the sex assigned to them at birth. A trans person may or may not identify on the (traditional male or female) gender binary. They may or may not use hormones or undergo surgery to achieve a new gender identity. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Deadnaming: The practice of calling or referring to a transgender person by the name they used at a previous time in life and are no longer using, whether or not calling them by that name is intentional. The best practice is to use the name the person has chosen. Terms for making a medical or surgical transition Every personâ€™s gender journey is unique. Some people make the transition with medical or surgical treatments, while others make the transition socially, changing the external expression of gender (hairstyle, clothing, etc.). Here are a few terms that can help. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender-affirming hormone therapy: Treatments that lead to the development of certain secondary sex characteristics. Depending on what the person is trying to achieve, they might include anti-androgens, estrogens, progestogens, or testosterone. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender-affirming surgeries: Surgical procedures that help people align their bodies to more closely match their gender identity. They may include chest and genital surgeries, body sculpting, facial feminization, and hair removal, among other treatments. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender-affirming genital surgery: A number of procedures that can be done to align the genitals and reproductive organs with a personâ€™s gender identity. (â€œBottom surgeryâ€ is slang for gender-affirming genital surgery.) aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender-affirming chest surgery: Surgery to either remove or construct a personâ€™s chest, depending on what they want to achieve. (â€œTop surgeryâ€ is slang for gender-affirming chest surgery.) One surgical procedure used to masculinize the chestâ€”called a bilateral mastectomyâ€”involves removing most of a personâ€™s breast tissue; it is often accompanied by repositioning of nipple areola and chest contouring. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Facial surgery: For a transgender woman, treatments may include Adamâ€™s apple reduction and procedures to reshape the nose or other areas of the face. Surgeries for a transgender man might include jaw augmentation or enhancement of the Adamâ€™s apple. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Breast augmentation: Using implants to enlarge the breasts. Other words to know when talking to a doctor about transgender care Using appropriate terms can help medical providers discuss transgender care with their patients, as well as diagnose and treat transgender patients with more accuracy. This applies whether the patient is seeking gender-affirming treatment or routine ongoing medical care. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Assigned male or female at birth: The sex assigned to a newborn based on the physical structure of their genitals and other biological characteristics at birth, including everything related to reproduction, such as hormones, chromosomes, and certain internal organs. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender dysphoria: Distress experienced by some people whose gender identity and sex assigned at birth donâ€™t match. When this distress becomes significant, both the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the American Medical Association (AMA) recognize it as a psychological diagnosis. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Intersex: From a medical perspective, the term describes a group of congenital (or at-birth) conditions in which the reproductive organs, genitals, and/or other sexual anatomy do not develop according to traditional expectations for females or males. Intersex can also be used as an identity term for someone with one of these conditions. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transition: The process of moving from the gender assigned at birth to becoming aligned with another gender identity (which could be anywhere along the gender spectrum). This happens over time and the trajectory is unique to each transgender person. Some may make a â€œsocial transition,â€ taking personal and legal steps such changing their name, pronouns, and gender expression, as well as telling family and friends, but undergo no medical interventions. Those who do make medical transitions may use hormone treatments to change their voice and distribution of body fat, among other characteristics. Some will have surgery to add or remove body parts related to the male or female genders. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Trans man (or transgender man): Someone assigned female sex at birth but now identifies as a boy/man/male, regardless of whether they have had surgery. Avoid using the term female-to-male (FTM). aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Trans woman (or transgender woman): Someone who was assigned male sex at birth but now identifies as a girl/woman/female, regardless of whether they have had surgery. Avoid using the term male-to-female (MTF). aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transsexual: A term used sometimes in the medical literature or by some transgender people to describe people who have gone through the process of medical gender affirmation treatments (i.e., gender-affirming hormones and surgeries). aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Chosen name/Name used: The name a person chooses to use for themselves and wants others to use. This name may be different from the name on that personâ€™s identification or insurance documents. Transgender terms to avoid There are other words that confuse the issue, including words in the LGBTQIA+ world that denote sexual attraction, and that some people mistakenly confuse with gender terms. These include gay, lesbian, bisexual, and pansexual (meaning attracted to people of all gender identities and biological sexes)â€”and they apply to transgender people in the same way they apply to cisgender people. In other words, a cisgender man who is attracted to other men is gay, and so is a transgender man who is attracted to other men. In addition, as experts learn more about the nuances of transgender issues, new terms have emerged to replace old ones that have come to be considered derogatory, disrespectful, or otherwise inappropriate. It may be best to simply ask people what terms they choose to use. Below are words to avoid: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transvestite: A person who dresses in clothes of the opposite sex. A transgender person or cisgender person may or may not cross-dress. "Cross-dresser" is the preferable term. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Hermaphrodite: Once used to describe conditions some people are born with in which reproductive organs, structures, or tissue donâ€™t fit clear male or female definitions. The term "intersex" should be used instead. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Sex-change operation: Once used to describe a surgery that alters the body for a person transitioning from the sex they were assigned at birth. Better terms to use are "gender-affirming surgery," "sex reassignment surgery," or "gender confirmation surgery." aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Tranny: Considered a slur. Instead, use â€œtransgender peopleâ€ or â€œtransgender person.â€ Special thanks to John Encandela, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry and member of the Deanâ€™s Advisory Council (DAC) for LGBTQIA+ Affairs at Yale School of Medicine, and a contributor to the DACâ€™s LGBTQIA+ Glossary of Terms for Teaching in Health Care.

Seven interactive, multi-media modules covering core concepts related to transgender people and communities. Launch Trans 101 course banner Modules Who Are Transgender People? Trans people experience significant health disparities. To reduce disparities, it is vital that we all learn more about transgender people and how to improve services for trans communities. Words That Matter, Part 1 Exploring core concepts related to gender, sex, and sexual orientation can help us understand different identities. What's in a Pronoun? To be respectful it's important to ask everyone what pronoun they use, and then use those pronouns consistently. Words That Matter, Part 2 We've presented a number of trans related terms. Let's put them into context. Facing Down Stigma Transgender people face stigma daily. Learn about the impact of transphobia on health outcomes. Words That Matter, Part 3 Let's apply some of these concepts in real world scenarios. How To Be an Ally Review core concepts and learn some initial steps to becoming an ally to trans communities.

It's led to legal disputes, protests and discussions about education and free speech. What does transgender mean? Gender identity is a term used by some to describe someone's sense of their gender. A transgender person's gender identity is not the same as the sex recorded on their original birth certificate. A transgender man is someone registered female at birth, but who identifies as a man. A transgender woman is someone registered male at birth, but who identifies as a woman.

Some people are born with chromosomal or other physical differences that can make this a complex judgement. They are sometimes referred to as intersex, or having differences of sexual development (DSD). How many transgender people are there in the UK? In the England and Wales census, 262,000 people aged 16 and over said their gender identity was different to their birth sex. Some academics raised concerns that the question may not have been understood and could be an overestimate. The Office for National Statistics said it was confident the results were processed accurately, but is reviewing the data. A 2018 estimate by the government suggested there could be between 200,000 and 500,000 people who identify as transgender across the UK. What changes can transgender people make? Many transgender people live according to their gender identity - including how they dress, and their chosen name and pronouns. Some may take hormone medication, or have surgery. People can also apply to alter their birth certificate, passport and driving licence. These social, physical and legal changes are known as transitioning. Under the Gender Recognition Act 2004, UK adults can change their legal sex if they meet certain criteria. This means their acquired gender can be recorded on their birth, marriage and death certificates. The main requirements include: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls A medical report of a gender dysphoria diagnosis aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Evidence of living full time in their acquired gender for at least two years aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls A declaration that they will live permanently in their acquired gender aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls They must be 18 or over and pay a £5 fee In the UK, non-binary is not recognised as a gender on legal documents including birth certificates and passports. About 7,000 gender recognition certificates have been issued in England, Wales and Scotland. A transgender rights protest in London Image source, Getty Images In 2018 the UK government began considering changes to the law in England and Wales, which it said would aim to make it easier for transgender people to change their legal gender on birth certificates. It decided not to go ahead with some of the proposed changes, but did move the application process online and lowered the cost of a certificate. In 2022, Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) voted to remove the need for a medical diagnosis and lower the application age to 16. However, the UK government blocked this from becoming law. Ministers said the draft law would conflict with equality protections applying across the whole of Great Britain. The Scottish government is challenging this decision in the courts. What does this mean for women's spaces? There has been debate about how to balance the rights of different groups within society. Much of this has focused on access to women-only spaces such as toilets, domestic abuse refuges and prisons. There has also been controversy about the participation of trans women in female-only categories in sports. Transgender people may wish to use services and facilities which align with their gender identity, whereas other groups say that these should be separated by birth sex. The Equality Act 2010 identifies a number of groups with protected characteristics - including gender reassignment and sex - and protects those groups from discrimination. But single-sex service providers can exclude transgender people where this is a ''proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim'', such as privacy or safety. However, some say the law is not clearly understood and women's sex-based rights are under threat. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Woman suing rape charity in trans row aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls British Cycling to ban trans women from female events The Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that amending the Equality Act definition of "sex" to "biological sex" is worth further consideration. It would make it simpler for certain spaces to be single-sex, regardless of whether a person has a Gender Recognition Certificate. The UK government is considering the advice. Gender identity and children There has been an increase in the number of children referred to the under-18s Gender Identity and Development Service (Gids) in England and Wales, especially among patients registered female at birth. NHS England says there were more than 5,000 referrals in 2021-2022, compared with 250 referrals in 2011-12. In some cases, young patients have been prescribed puberty blockers. These delay the onset of puberty, but the NHS says little is known about their long term side effects. An independent review said the current service is "unsustainable" and that many children referred to Gids have complex needs. It said these can sometimes be overlooked once they are diagnosed with gender dysphoria and called for a "fundamentally different" model of care for children. Following the review, the NHS decided puberty blockers should only be given to children and adolescents as part of clinical research. NHS England announced Gids will close in March 2024 and regional clinics working alongside children's hospitals will open. Young people in Scotland can get a GP referral or refer themselves to the gender service at the Sandyford Clinic. Those in Northern Ireland who want to talk to a specialist about their gender identity can use the Knowing Our Identity service. In Wales, children or teenagers thought to have gender dysphoria will usually be referred to a specialist child and adolescent Gender Identity Clinic.

In its original and narrower sense, transgender referred to males and females who respectively gender-identify as females and males. In a later and broader sense, it has come to designate persons whose gender identities incorporate behaviours and traits traditionally associated with the opposite sex. Transgender persons may thus include transsexuals, transgenderists (in one usage of the term, persons who gender-identify with the opposite sex but who choose not to undergo sex-reassignment surgery or hormone treatments), and androgynes (biologically or psychologically androgynous persons), among other groups. In its broader sense, transgender is closely related to the more-recent term genderqueer, which is self-applied by persons who are either transgender or who have no gender, a third (neither male nor female) gender, or a fluctuating gender.

(BUTTON) (more) See all videos for this article In part because there is no universally accepted definition of transgender (different researchers use the term in different ways), it is uncertain how many transgender persons there are. Estimates in the United States, based on the broad definition used in this article, have varied from less than 1 percent to more than 3 percent of the population in the early 21st century. Sex, gender, and sexual orientation The notion of transgender presupposes fundamental distinctions between the concepts of sex, gender, and sexual orientation (see human sexual behaviour). Whereas sex is a biological category, gender refers to the set of traits and behaviours that are traditionally associated with a particular sex. A person who is transgender experiences and expresses a disjunction between sex and gender. Sexual orientation, in contrast, is defined in terms of the sexes or genders to which a person is sexually, emotionally, or romantically attracted. It is a widespread but mistaken assumption that transgender persons are necessarily homosexual (i.e., attracted to members of the sex that they were assigned at birth). Although some are homosexual, others are heterosexual or bisexual or do not identify with any particular sexual orientation. Theoretical background Various theories of gender have been proposed as explanations of the experience of transgender persons. In addition to the concepts of sex and gender, those of gender identity and gender expression are particularly important for such theories. Gender identity refers to a personâ€™s self-identification as male or female or as something in between or outside of those categories. Gender expression refers to the behaviour through which one expresses oneâ€™s gender identityâ€”e.g., by using certain pronouns or wearing certain kinds of clothing or having a particular hairstyle. Whereas gender identity is not something that others can view, gender expression is publicly visible. The main theories of gender are essentialism, social constructionism, and performativity. Essentialists place emphasis on biological characteristics, arguing that a personâ€™s gender identity is fixed at birth, whether or not it corresponds to biological sex. Essentialism is thus opposed to the view that gender identity is entirely socially constructedâ€”i.e., a product of social or societal influences. The central case in need of explanation, according to essentialists, is that of persons who report having always (for as long as they can remember) felt that they belonged to the sex opposite the one that they were assigned at birth. Such experiences are typical of transsexuals, who feel the need to change their sex to match the gender identity they feel they have always had. Social constructionism, as the term suggests, is the view that gender is socially constructed. That gender is socially constructed is shown, according to constructionists, by the fact that the traits and behaviours traditionally associated with the male or female sex have varied over time and across cultures, which would not be the case if gender were innate. It is important to note that essentialism and social constructivism, as those theories are defined in this article, are not necessarily inconsistent, insofar as they aim to explain different (though obviously related) things: the one concerns the supposed biological origin of gender identity (oneâ€™s self-identification as male or female), the other the supposed social or societal origin of gender (the traits and behaviours that make up the masculine or the feminine). It is entirely possible that the former is innate and the latter largely, if not entirely, learned, in the broad sense of being instilled.

Subscribe Now As to sex, some social constructivists claim that it too is not biologically given but rather pronounced by medical professionals whose role it is to place infants into one or the other category at birth. A prominent defender of that view is the American philosopher Judith Butler, who is also known as a developer of the performative theory of gender. An extension of social constructivism is the performative theory, or performativity, which holds that gender is a â€œperformanceâ€ that people undertake on a daily basis, even if only unconsciously. In particular, gender is not the expression of an underlying essence or nature, whether based on sex or on gender identity. It is rather a series of acts whose constant repetition creates the illusion that an underlying nature exists. According to Butler, gender â€œis performatively constituted by the very â€˜expressionsâ€™ that are said to be its results.â€ Kimberly Tauches The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica IFRAME: //www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-5W6NC8

The 2015 Supreme Court ruling in favor of the freedom to marry was a major step toward legal equality, and there have been many successes since then at the federal, state, and local levels, including increased protections for transgender and gender non-conforming people. However, since the ruling, there have also been more than 200 anti-LGBT bills introduced in 20 statesâ€”and a recently leaked executive order draft suggests that the current administration intends to undermine established non-discrimination protections and open the door to a wide range of harms to the LGBT population. To help make sense of the current policy landscape in the states for LGBT people, and transgender people specifically, Mapping Transgender Equality in the United States looks at legal equality for transgender people across the country. The gender identity tally is comprised of 25 state laws and policies in the five key categories of Non-Discrimination, LGBT Youth Laws and Policies, Health and Safety, Ability for Transgender People to Correct the Name and Gender Marker on Identity Documents, and Adoption and Parenting. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Mapping Transgender Equality in the United StatesDownload Recommended citation: Movement Advancement Project.

Sexual Orientation Policy Tally The term â€œsexual orientationâ€ is loosely defined as a personâ€™s pattern of romantic or sexual attraction to people of the opposite sex or gender, the same sex or gender, or more than one sex or gender. Laws that explicitly mention sexual orientation primarily protect or harm lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. That said, transgender people who are lesbian, gay or bisexual can be affected by laws that explicitly mention sexual orientation. Gender Identity Policy Tally â€œGender identityâ€ is a personâ€™s deeply-felt inner sense of being male, female, or something else or in-between. â€œGender expressionâ€ refers to a personâ€™s characteristics and behaviors such as appearance, dress, mannerisms and speech patterns that can be described as masculine, feminine, or something else. Gender identity and expression are independent of sexual orientation, and transgender people may identify as heterosexual, lesbian, gay or bisexual. Laws that explicitly mention â€œgender identityâ€ or â€œgender identity and expressionâ€ primarily protect or harm transgender people. These laws also can apply to people who are not transgender, but whose sense of gender or manner of dress does not adhere to gender stereotypes. Thanks for signing up!

Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. The population size of transgender individuals in the United States is not well-known, in part because official records, including the US Census, do not include data on gender identity. Population surveys today more often collect transgender-inclusive gender-identity data, and secular trends in culture and the media have created a somewhat more favorable environment for transgender people. Objectives. To estimate the current population size of transgender individuals in the United States and evaluate any trend over time. Search methods. In June and July 2016, we searched PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science for national surveys, as well as "gray" literature, through an Internet search. We limited the search to 2006 through 2016. Selection criteria. We selected population-based surveys that used probability sampling and included self-reported transgender-identity data. Data collection and analysis. We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool eligible surveys and used meta-regression to address our hypothesis that the transgender population size estimate would increase over time. We used subsample and leave-one-out analysis to assess for bias. Main results. Our meta-regression model, based on 12 surveys covering 2007 to 2015, explained 62.5% of model heterogeneity, with a significant effect for each unit increase in survey year (F = 17.122; df = 1,10; b = 0.026%; P = .002). Extrapolating these results to 2016 suggested a current US population size of 390 adults per 100 000, or almost 1 million adults nationally. This estimate may be more indicative for younger adults, who represented more than 50% of the respondents in our analysis. Authors' conclusions. Future national surveys are likely to observe higher numbers of transgender people. The large variety in questions used to ask about transgender identity may account for residual heterogeneity in our models. Public health implications. Under- or nonrepresentation of transgender individuals in population surveys is a barrier to understanding social determinants and health disparities faced by this population. We recommend using standardized questions to identify respondents with transgender and nonbinary gender identities, which will allow a more accurate population size estimate. PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY We used data from national surveys to estimate the population size of transgender people in the United States. Estimates of the number of transgender adults significantly increased over the past decade, with a current best estimate of 390 per 100 000 adults. That is about 1 in every 250 adults, or almost 1 million Americans. These numbers may be more typical of younger adults than of the entire US population. We expect that future surveys will find higher numbers of transgender people and recommend that standardized questions be used, which will allow a more accurate population size estimate.

Particularly alarming is that 41% of survey respondents reported at least 1 suicide attempt. A barrier to understanding social determinants and health disparities faced by transgender people is the under- or nonrepresentation in a range of demographic and health-monitoring activities,^5 which may result from a lack of transgender-inclusive data collection with regard to gender identity. Accurate representation of the transgender population is complicated by the diversity within the community with regard to language and subcultures.^6,7 Moreover, the clinical literature has long conflated transgender identity with homosexuality.^8,9 Although a relationship between gender identity and sexual orientation may exist, the American Psychological Association (APA) recognizes that "Transgender people, like cis-gender people, may be sexually oriented toward men, women, both sexes, or neither sex. . . ."^10,11 Current best practice for collecting transgender-inclusive gender identity data is the 2-step method, which has been shown to optimize accurate identification of transgender people in a population.^12 This method records current gender identity as well as the sex assigned at birth; transgender people are those who identify as such and those whose current gender identity and sex assigned at birth differ.^13 This method allows the capture of people who identify with a binary gender (male or female), such as a transgender man who identifies only as male,^14 as well as others who may be considered transgender from a demographic perspective, even if they do not identify with the term "transgender," such as people who identify as genderqueer, agender, or having no gender.^15,16 The US Census and other official records kept by such agencies as the National Archives or state departments of motor vehicles report sex, typically based on the sex assigned at birth or the legal sex, but they do not report current gender identity. They are also not able to record whether the legal sex differs from the sex assigned at birth. As a result, at the most basic level, the population size of transgender individuals in the United States is not well-known. On the basis of a limited number of sources in 2009, the APA estimated the number of transgender individuals in the United States at 115 000 to 450 000, or 38 to 147 per 100 000 by using US Census data for that year's total population size.^11 The value of these numbers is limited, as the lower limit was based on members of a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Web site who identified as transgender, which is unlikely to be representative of the US general population, and the upper limit was based on an older and in part nonprobability sample of North Americans,^17 which may not reflect current numbers in the United States. More recent US population-based surveys have reported transgender population sizes that are higher, ranging from 153 to 1647 per 100 000.^18 These estimates may not generalize to the United States as a whole, as they were based on data collected in Massachusetts adults^19 and 9th to 12th graders in Boston public schools.^20 Perhaps the best current estimate is provided by Flores et al. who estimated that 0.6% of US adults, approximately 560 per 100 000, identify as transgender.^21 They used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is administered annually to randomly selected adults across the United States. Because contemporary surveys more often collect transgender-inclusive gender-identity data, and secular trends in culture and the media have created a somewhat more favorable environment for transgender people, it is possible that the measured size of the transgender population has increased over time, rendering previous reports of population size even less applicable today. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the number of transgender individuals in the United States by performing a meta-analysis of population-based national surveys. A secondary aim was to evaluate for any trend over time. We hypothesized that the estimates of transgender population size would increase over time. Knowledge of the transgender population size can support the development of social policy that aims to protect transgender individuals against stigma and discrimination. From a health perspective, knowledge of the size of the transgender population can inform the development of health care programs to benefit transgender people, as well as inform insurance companies on how to best provide coverage for such care. METHODS We systematically searched for national surveys in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science. The search was limited to 2006 to 2016, as older surveys are unlikely to contain transgender-inclusive gender-identity data. Eligible surveys were population-based and nonclinical, as recommended by Deutsch,^18 and collected data on transgender identity in probability samples. The search combined the terms "national" and "survey" in titles or abstracts with "gender identity" anywhere in the publication and was performed on July 5, 2016. Knowing that large national surveys often have dedicated Web pages that report methods and data (e.g., the BRFSS, the National Health Interview Survey [NHIS]), we also searched the Internet for "gray" literature with the search terms "survey," "gender," and "health" in the Internet domains ".gov," ".edu," and ".us," which are the domains affiliated with the United States. We performed this search with the Google search engine between June 1 and 13, 2016. We included the search term "health" to narrow these Internet search results, assuming that surveys with transgender-inclusive gender-identity data would most likely be health-related. With the Internet search results ordered by relevance, we identified US surveys among the first 500 hits. We revisited Web sites for recurring surveys to check for new data until November 9, 2016. Across both searches, we excluded satisfaction surveys, surveys that were not based on self-report (e.g., parents reporting about children), surveys that were not about humans (e.g., tobacco-free colleges, health plans or health insurance, LGBT curriculum content), surveys that were not based on national samples (e.g., surveys covering state, county, or cities only), and reviews and meta-analyses of multiple surveys. We further excluded surveys that did not specifically report transgender identities (e.g., surveys that reported counts for "another gender" or counts for a response option that combined "transgender" and "other"). We collected gender-identity data for each unique survey located through either the Internet search or search in traditional scientific databases from the original search result or reports on the survey's Web site. We completed an investigator-developed data extraction form for each eligible survey with data on survey year, population, sampling design, question(s) used to assess transgender identity, and the total sample size and number who self-reported as transgender. The first author extracted and double-checked all data. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses based on the proportion of transgender individuals. Pooling of multiple survey samples, including multiple waves for recurring surveys, has been used before to estimate population size in gender and sexual minorities.^22,23 Random-effects analysis is appropriate when study heterogeneity can be expected.^24 We present plots and calculated the I^2 statistic to estimate residual heterogeneity. This statistic indicates whether variation is more likely attributable to study heterogeneity or to chance.^25 To assess potential bias we conducted subsample analysis and leave-one-out analysis to test whether single surveys had a disproportionally large effect. We used meta-regression to assess our hypothesis regarding a trend in estimated population size over time. We used the Knapp-Hartung method to control type-I error in meta-regressions.^26 We used R version 3.2.2 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) for all statistical analyses. RESULTS We initially identified 65 surveys. After we excluded duplicates and surveys that did not meet our eligibility criteria, 5 surveys remained for analysis, spanning 2006 to 2016 (Figure 1). Accounting for data from multiple waves of recurring surveys (4 out of 5), our final analysis included 20 samples. Table 1 describes each of these samples in more detail. Among them, 6 samples (30%) were drawn from the general population and 14 (70%) from college and university students and adult inmates. It is worth mentioning that only the BRFSS samples and the 2016 wave of the National College Health Assessment (NCHA) collected data on gender identities not captured by the terms male, female, or transgender (e.g., genderqueer, gender-nonconforming), and that only the 2014 wave of the National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) and the 2016 NCHA inquired after sex assigned at birth.^27-30 An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is AJPH.2016.303578f1.jpg Open in a separate window FIGURE 1 --- Selection of Population-Based Surveys That Reported Transgender Identity: United States, 2006-2016 TABLE 1 --- Characteristics of Samples in Surveys That Reported Transgender Identity Included in the Analysis: United States, 2006-2016 Survey Name and Year Sample Size Self-Identified Transgender Age Range, Years Sample Description Categorized as Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2015^a 165 299 598 [greater-than-or-equal]18 General-population adults Gender identity 2014^b 154 062 575 [greater-than-or-equal]18 General-population adults Gender identity National Adult Tobacco Survey 2014^c 75 233 19 [greater-than-or-equal]18 General-population adults Sexual orientation 2013 60 221 17 [greater-than-or-equal]18 General-population adults Sexual orientation 2010 118 581 96 [greater-than-or-equal]18 General-population adults Sexual orientation National College Health Assessment 2016^d 94 376 1685 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Gender identity 2015 93 034 416 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Gender identity 2014 79 266 271 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Gender identity 2013 123 078 299 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Gender identity 2012 90 666 214 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Gender identity 2011 105 781 226 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Gender identity 2010 95 712 204 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Gender identity 2009 87 101 131 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Gender identity 2008 78 551 82 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Sexual orientation 2007 69 965 75 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Sexual orientation 2006 92 133 82 18-31 Students of colleges and universities Sexual orientation National Health Interview Survey: 2013 33 784 3 [greater-than-or-equal]18 General-population adults Sexual orientation National Inmate Survey 2012 91 117 230 [greater-than-or-equal]18 Adult inmates in local jails and state and federal prisons Gender identity 2009 76 459 186 [greater-than-or-equal]18 Adult inmates in local jails and state and federal prisons Gender identity 2007 63 817 149 [greater-than-or-equal]18 Adult inmates in local jails and state and federal prisons Gender identity Open in a separate window ^a154 endorsed "not male, female, or transgender." ^b116 endorsed "not male, female, or transgender." ^c233 with a different sex assigned at birth not included in self-identified transgender number. ^d1243 with a different sex assigned at birth not included in self-identified transgender number. Survey Questions Questions used to collect data on transgender identity varied greatly. A majority of surveys (n = 13 or 65%) asked about being transgender in the context of gender identity, in accordance with current understanding that transgender is a gender identity that is different from a person's sex assigned at birth.^1 These surveys included the 2014 and 2015 BRFSS,^27,28 the NCHA starting with the 2009 wave of data collection,^30-37 and the National Inmate Survey.^38-42 The remaining surveys (n = 7 or 35%) offered "transgender" as a response option in the context of sexual-orientation questions. These surveys included the 2013 NHIS,^43 the NATS,^29,44,45 and the NCHA before the 2009 wave of data collection.^46-48 Although transgender as sexual orientation does not reflect current understanding of transgender as a gender identity, and sexual orientation and gender identity are distinct phenomena,^8,11,14 we conducted separate meta-analyses for "transgender" collected as gender identity and "transgender" as sexual orientation for the sake of comparison. Questions that probed gender identity included "Do you consider yourself to be transgender?"; "Do you identify as transgender?"; "Are you male, female, or transgender?"; and "What is your gender?" In addition to male or female gender options, response options included "transgender"^31,38 and "male-to-female," "female-to-male," and "gender-nonconforming."^27 Sexual-orientation questions with transgender response options included "Which of the following best describes you?"; "Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?"; and "Do you consider yourself to be. . . ?" or "Do you think of yourself as. . .?" Response options included "transgender,"^45 "transgendered,"^46 and "You are transgender, transsexual, or gender variant."^29,43 Transgender Population Size The estimated proportion of transgender individuals based on surveys that categorized transgender as gender identity was 0.39% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16, 0.62; I^2 = 99.8%; k = 13). In terms of overall sample proportion, college and university students represented the majority (58%), followed by general-population adults (24%) and adult inmates (18%). Leave-one-out analysis of these surveys showed a marked effect on the population estimate when the 2016 NCHA was left out (0.28%; 95% CI = 0.23, 0.32; I^2 = 96.4%). Figure 2 shows a forest plot with the individual survey contributions. To assess the effect of including recurring surveys, we reanalyzed the data while including only the latest wave and leaving out the 2016 NCHA as a potential outlier. The estimated proportion of transgender individuals when we used this reduced data set spanning 2012 to 2015 was 0.35% (95% CI = 0.24, 0.46; I^2 = 96.8%; k = 3). The 2014 NATS and the 2016 NCHA respectively reported that 0.31% and 1.3% of respondents had indicated a sex assigned at birth that differed from their current gender identity. These respondents were not included in our population-size estimates.^29,30 An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is AJPH.2016.303578f2.jpg Open in a separate window FIGURE 2 --- Proportion of Transgender Adults in Surveys That Categorized Transgender as a Gender Identity: United States, 2007-2016 Note. BRFSS = Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; N = total sample size; NCHA = National College Health Assessment; NIS = National Inmate Survey. To test the hypothesis for changes over time, we conducted a meta-regression with the estimated proportion of transgender individuals as a dependent variable for surveys that categorized transgender as gender identity, but leaving out the 2016 NCHA as a potential outlier. A meta-regression model that included the year of the survey as predictor, centered with respect to 2007, explained 62.5% of model heterogeneity, with a significant effect for each unit increase in survey year (F = 17.122; df = 1,10; b = 0.026%; P = .002). A test for residual heterogeneity was also significant (QE = 99.687; df = 10; P &lt; .001). Figure 3 visualizes the results of this meta-regression. Not surprisingly, the annual increase was considerably larger when we included 2016 NCHA (F = 4.944; df = 1,11; b = 0.086%; P = .048).

Data points are scaled, with larger circles indicating smaller standard errors. The dashed lines indicate the 95% confidence interval about the regression line. The estimated proportion of transgender individuals based on surveys that categorized transgender as sexual orientation was 0.06% (95% CI = 0.03, 0.09; I^2 = 96.6%; k = 7). It should be noted that presenting transgender in the context of sexual orientation does not reflect our current understanding of what it means to be transgender. We include these data for comparison only and doing so should not be taken as validation that presenting transgender as a sexual orientation is in any way appropriate. Leave-one-out analysis showed no disproportionate effect of single surveys. A direct comparison of estimates showed that the proportion for transgender categorized as sexual orientation was significantly lower than the overall proportion for transgender categorized as gender identity (0.06% vs 0.28%; t = 7.317; P &lt; .001, corrected for unequal variances). DISCUSSION Our meta-regression of US population-based surveys indicated a substantial annual increase in the number of transgender adults in the United States. As a consequence, meta-analyses that pool data across several years, including our own, will likely underestimate their numbers. A conservative estimate extrapolating our meta-regression results, while excluding the latest NCHA wave of data as a potential outlier, suggests that the proportion of transgender adults in the United States is 0.39%, or 390 per 100 000, and almost 1 million adults nationally. It should be noted that this estimate may be more indicative for younger adults and that national surveys in the near future may observe higher numbers of transgender people. We speculate that the observed annual increase is not an increase of the true population size, but the result of people feeling freer to report that they are or identify as transgender. This may result from societal changes, such as increased public visibility, awareness, and acceptance of transgender individuals.^49 The fact that US society is more aware of transgender issues is also reflected in public interest in the search term "transgender," which, according to Google Trends, has steadily increased since 2011. PubMed results for the number of publications found with the search term "transgender" show a similar phenomenon, with relatively small increases since 2005, but large increases in the number of publications since 2011. Comparison of our population-size estimate with international numbers is not straightforward because, even within a single country, differences in social acceptance affect the number of individuals who are willing to self-report a transgender identity.^50 This is why we based our analysis on US national samples only. Our estimate of 0.39% is not quite as high as the 1% that was posited on the basis of a qualitative review of international studies.^51 However, this high number was supported by new data from a Dutch population sample aged 15 to 70 years, which found that 1.1% of men and 0.8% of women experienced a gender identity incongruent with their sex assigned at birth.^52 Our estimate is also lower than the 0.6% reported by Flores et al., who applied a rigorous statistical technique to extrapolate data from a single survey administered in 19 states to a national level.^21 "Transgender" as a Label The label "transgender" is often used as an umbrella term, but does not fully capture the larger gender-nonconforming or gender-variant population, as surveys in our analysis illustrated. In both waves of the BRFSS included in our analysis, more than 20% of respondents endorsed "gender-nonconforming." Other surveys that were not eligible for our analysis showed an even starker contrast between "transgender" and other nonbinary options. In a recent national nonprobability sample, the number of respondents who endorsed "genderqueer or gender nonconforming" was about 1.5 times the number who endorsed "transgender."^53 In the 2013 and 2015 Minnesota College Student Health Survey, twice as many respondents endorsed "genderqueer" or "another gender" than "transgender."^54,55 Other surveys that were not included in our analysis because they specifically recruited LGBT individuals also indicated a sizable proportion of respondents who endorsed other gender options. For example, 6th- to 12th-grade students in a national sample endorsed "genderqueer" more often than "transgender," and the number who endorsed "another gender" was almost half of those who endorsed "transgender."^15 In a national survey of LGBT individuals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, again, more endorsed "genderqueer" than "transgender," whereas the number who endorsed "androgynous" was slightly more than half of those who endorsed "transgender."^16 Also, not all transgender people identify with the term "transgender" (e.g., a transgender woman who identifies as female only).^14,56 As such, surveys that include "transgender" as the only option other than male or female are likely to underestimate the population size under the transgender umbrella. The available evidence suggests that the size of the gender-nonconforming or gender-variant population may be twice as large as our best estimate for the transgender population size. According to our analysis, surveys that considered transgender a sexual orientation resulted in at least a 4-fold underestimate of the number of transgender individuals. This underestimate should not come as a surprise, because transgender as sexual orientation does not reflect current understanding of transgender as gender identity.^11,14 It is striking, therefore, that national surveys such as the NHIS and NATS, and state surveys such as the Illinois and Idaho BRFSS,^57,58 until recent years, have categorized transgender as a sexual orientation rather than a gender identity. This practice misrepresents the number of transgender people in the United States and sustains misconceptions about what it means to be transgender. Of note, as of 2015, the NHIS no longer lists transgender as an option under sexual orientation. Strengths and Limitations Several considerations should be made when one is interpreting the results of our study. First, transgender people differ greatly and not all transgender individuals desire or have the resources to seek surgeries, hormone therapy, or change their name or sex designation on legal documents.^1 We believe that our analysis based on self-reported data provides a more accurate estimate of the number of transgender individuals than estimates based on characteristics that represent subsamples of the transgender population only (e.g., only those who seek surgery). Second, only about a quarter of the included surveys reported on the general population. More than half of the surveys on which our population-size estimate was based reported on younger adults (college and university students), and research has shown that individuals aged 18 to 24 years are more likely to identify as transgender.^21 Also, the incarceration rate among transgender individuals is disproportionally high,^4 especially among transgender women, and as such they may be overrepresented in samples drawn from the inmate population, which represented 20% of respondents in our analyses. Both aspects may lead to higher population size estimates and may not generalize to US adults as a whole. Third, evidence from surveys that asked about sex assigned at birth suggested that the number of adults whose sex assigned at birth differs from their current gender identity could be as large as our current estimate of the transgender population size. As such, our analysis may not have captured all individuals who are considered transgender from a demographic perspective, but who do not identify explicitly with the term "transgender." How the sum of these factors that may have affected our estimate ultimately add up is a complex question that perhaps can be answered when more accurate general population data become available. Also, survey errors with respect to data recording, although they are expected to be small, may have affected our estimate, especially because the base rate of the transgender population is small. Lastly, our analysis indicated significant amounts of residual heterogeneity, which can potentially be explained by differences in respondent characteristics (e.g., general population, students, inmates) and the types of questions used to assess transgender identity.^59 For example, the 2015 wave of the NCHA asked about respondents' gender with 0.45% endorsing transgender, whereas respondents in the 2016 wave were asked whether they identified as transgender (1.8% responded yes). The small number of surveys in our analysis did not allow for testing more than 1 model predictor. Conclusions We aimed to estimate the current transgender population size in the United States. On the basis of our analysis of national probability samples, 390 per 100 000 adults are estimated to be transgender in 2016, but the evidence suggests that future surveys will likely observe higher numbers. Our analysis also found that surveys use a variety of questions to ask about transgender identity and may still miscategorize transgender as a sexual orientation. This categorization does not reflect current understanding of transgender as a gender identity, and we recommend using standardized questions to identify respondents with transgender and nonbinary gender identities in future population surveys. Best practices regarding questions that can be used for transgender-inclusive data collection have already been published.^13 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research grant T32 NR07088.

This is known as the gender binary. But thatâ€™s not how every person experiences their own gender. If your gender is different from the â€œmaleâ€ or â€œfemaleâ€ label on your original birth certificate, you may identify as transgender. If your gender doesnâ€™t fit into the gender binary, you may identify as nonbinary. What's gender identity? Gender identity describes the inner experience of your own gender â€” whether you feel like a man, woman, genderqueer, agender, nonbinary, or another identity. Remember: Thereâ€™s no right or wrong way to look like a woman, man, or nonbinary person. What does transgender mean? Transgender means your gender identity is different from the gender that the doctor gave you when you were born, based on the way your body looked. That label is called â€œsex assigned at birthâ€ â€” usually â€œmaleâ€ or â€œfemale.â€ Transgender people use different terms to describe themselves. Always use the language and labels that a person uses for themselves. What does nonbinary mean? If your gender doesnâ€™t fit under the label of either â€œmaleâ€ or â€œfemale,â€ then you may identify as nonbinary. Your gender identity may be nonbinary if youâ€™re: both a man and a woman, in between, or totally outside those categories. What does cisgender mean? If you have the same gender identity as the sex the doctor assigned you at birth, youâ€™re "cisgender" â€” like a man who was assigned male at birth or a woman who was assigned female at birth. Whatâ€™s gender expression? How someone expresses their gender identity is called gender expression. Like cisgender people, transgender people express their gender identities in different ways â€” through dress, behavior, mannerisms, and more. Whatâ€™s a gender modality? â€œCisgenderâ€ and â€œtransgenderâ€ are key gender modalities. Your gender modality describes whether your gender identity corresponds to your sex assigned at birth. For example, a cisgender womanâ€™s gender modality is â€œcisgenderâ€ and her gender identity is â€œwoman.â€ Transgender is both a gender identity and a gender modality. For example, a woman who was assigned male at birth may have a gender identity of â€œtransgender womanâ€ or â€œwoman.â€ Her gender modality may be â€œtransgenderâ€ or â€œnot cisgender.â€ Whatâ€™s gender dysphoria? Many trans and nonbinary people experience gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is distress, unhappiness, and anxiety related to the mismatch between your gender identity and important aspects of your body â€” such as your genitals, voice, or chest. You also can have gender dysphoria if youâ€™re treated socially as the wrong gender, like when people use the wrong pronouns for you. While psychologists used to call gender dysphoria â€œgender identity disorder,â€ being transgender and/or nonbinary isnâ€™t a mental illness. Challenges and distress can be common for trans and nonbinary folks because of transphobia (AKA transmisia) â€” the ways that society treats transgender and nonbinary people as less than human. Not everyone experiences gender dysphoria. When they do, it can be different for each person. The same is true for gender euphoria. Whatâ€™s gender euphoria? Gender euphoria is the joy, relief, or well-being that many transgender and nonbinary people feel in their gender identity. Gender euphoria might happen when someone feels harmony between their gender identity and their body and/or their gender expression. Gender euphoria also occurs when someone is treated socially in alignment with their gender identity, like when people use affirming gendered language. An example would be a trans woman feeling good when sheâ€™s called â€œmaâ€™am.â€ Gender euphoria can be a benefit of transitioning â€” making changes to live in harmony with your gender identity. Trans people use different kinds of transition to feel more like their gender identity. Is transgender a sexual orientation? Nope! People often confuse gender identity, which is about who you are inside, with sexual orientation, which is about who youâ€™re attracted to. Sexual orientation â€” like lesbian, gay, bisexual, and more â€” describes sexual or romantic attraction to different genders. Gender modality and gender identity are about what gender you are, not what gender youâ€™re attracted to. Just like transgender people can have any gender identity or gender expression, they can also have any sexual or romantic orientation. What does passing mean? Passing means others see you as the gender that you identify as. For example, a transgender woman seen as a cisgender woman is â€œpassing.â€ Some transgender people feel that passing is important emotionally because it affirms their gender identity. They may experience passing as a positive thing that sparks gender euphoria. Other transgender people donâ€™t care about passing or donâ€™t want to â€œbe readâ€ as cisgender. For them, passing suggests transgender and nonbinary people have to look and sound like cisgender people for their gender identity to be â€œreal.â€ They may also see passing as accepting transphobia/transmisia â€” that the only trans people who get to be safe are the ones who donâ€™t â€œlook trans.â€ Because of transphobia/transmisia, passing can provide safety from harassment and violence. Someone who passes is likely to have an easier time moving through the world than a person whoâ€™s seen as transgender. This person has â€œpassing privilege.â€ No matter what a person "looks like," their gender identity is always valid and real. Where can I get safe gender-affirming medical care? You deserve safe health care. To find an affordable trans-competent nurse or doctor, it can be helpful to do an internet search, ask trans and nonbinary people in your community, or talk to someone from a local LGBTQ+ community organization. Planned Parenthood health centers serve people of all genders. Anyone can visit their nearest Planned Parenthood health center for STD testing, birth control, physical exams, other sexual and reproductive health services, and referrals. Find your nearest Planned Parenthood health center and learn about the services it offers. Many Planned Parenthood health centers are able to offer gender-affirming hormone treatment (sometimes called GAHT). The best way to learn about the services available in your area is to contact your nearest Planned Parenthood health center. If your closest Planned Parenthood health center doesnâ€™t offer gender-affirming hormone treatments, and you want them to, you can tell them. Hearing from patients helps your nearest Planned Parenthood add services that you need. They may be able to recommend a trans-friendly doctor in your area who provides the services you need.

Transgender people may experience discomfort or distress due to their gender not aligning with their sex, and therefore wish to transition to being the gender they identify with. Some transgender people feel this way from a very young age, while others go through a period of questioning before realizing they are transgender. Transgender people can be any gender. They can have any sexual orientation, express their gender through their appearance in any way, and may or may not fit into society's views of gender. People whose sex corresponds to their gender identity are referred to as cisgender. Terminology There are a wide range of terms used in reference to transgender people, and the definitions of words often vary over time, or between different groups of people. it is always important to check in with individuals which words they prefer to use rather than to assign them labels they may not be comfortable with. Generally, all discussion of transgender people is focused on gender identity. For example, a trans man is someone who views themselves as a man and was assigned female at birth. It is his internal experience (as a man) which determines how he is described, not the way he is seen by society. Similarly, a trans woman views herself as a woman and was assigned male at birth. This can confuse those who are new to discussions of transgender identity, but it's an important distinction. This distinction is based on the understanding that gender and sex are separate, where 'gender' means internal experience, and 'sex' means the attributes of the body. Therefore, a woman (gender) can have a penis and XY chromosomes (sex), but this does not affect her self-identity as a woman, except for the possibility that she was raised to see herself as a man. Terms such as "male-bodied" and "female-bodied" are often seen as inappropriate because they confuse gender with sex. A trans woman is a woman, and therefore her body is female because it belongs to a woman. Instead, the terminology "assigned male/female/intersex at birth" is used to indicate whether a person is born male or female. This terminology also acknowledges that gender varies between societies, and some cultures recognize three or more genders. It is worth noting that some people are born with sex characteristics that cannot be easily classified as either male or female. This is known as being intersex, and many intersex individuals are unaware of their condition. Those who are not intersex are referred to as dyadic. Other important concepts are the gender binary and the gender spectrum. The gender binary refers to the idea that there are only two genders, man and woman, and that everyone can be categorized as one or the other. However, many people feel that their gender identity is non-binary and cannot be described as either of these identities. Another term used for people who fall outside the gender binary is genderqueer, which is often used to imply a desire to change the norms of gender. The gender spectrum on the other hand is the idea that gender isn't binary but a continuum. At it simplest is a line between male and female. The next step up is a 2D pane with male and female on the axis. The next step is adding in Aporagenders(genders not related to male or female) each on their own axis. The final step is Gender Field theory where gender is a N-dimensional field. For more on the different theories of gender see Models of gender identity. Transition Transition is any action a transgender person takes in order for the external world to better recognize and reflect their internal gender. This can range from asking people to use different names and pronouns, to a change in dress or appearance, to extensive surgery. The three main forms of transition are social, legal, and medical, although all of these are broad categories which can reflect dozens of different possible actions. Transgender people often have dysphoria (feelings of distress) arising from their sex characteristics not matching their self-image and/or being seen and treated as the wrong gender (misgendered). This dysphoria may be referred to by the medical term of Gender Identity Disorder, for which the correct treatment is considered to be transition, accompanied by any necessary support to achieve the desired state. Some transgender people have gender euphoria (feelings of elation) from making or thinking about their body, gender expression and/or being seen and treated as prefered gender. Every transgender person has different desires for what they want (or do not want) to include in their transition, including surgery and other medical procedures. Transgender people who do not plan to have surgery are sometimes referred to as non-op; transsexual is sometimes used to refer to only those who do. It is important not to make assumptions about what is, was or will be involved in any individual person's transition. Some transgender people are aware of their condition as children and begin transitioning then, such as by taking puberty blockers to delay the development of sex characteristics until they are old enough to be allowed to medically transition. However, many attempt to reconcile themselves with living as their assigned gender, and only transition later in life when they realize they are not happy with the way things are. This may involve a period of questioning in which a person is uncertain of their gender identity, and wishes to explore before settling on a label for themselves. Even after transition, transgender people may not want to reflect societal stereotypes of their gender identity. For instance, a trans woman can be masculine, a tomboy, work as a mechanic, or hate wearing dresses - just as a cis woman can do any of those things.

Home 2. Transgender/ Non Binary / Gender Nonconforming Passengers Transgender/ Non Binary / Gender Nonconforming Passengers TSA recognizes the concerns that some members of the transgender/non binary/gender nonconforming traveling public have with screening technology and certain security screening procedures at the nationâ€™s security checkpoints. TSA is committed to ensuring all travelers are treated with respect and dignity. Screening is conducted without regard to a person's race, color, sex, gender, gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability. Prior to the Airport TSA Precheck® Enhancements The TSA PreCheck program application has been updated to include an additional gender marker option to better serve non-binary and gender non-conforming Americans. This action will ensure the TSA PreCheck system accurately reflects the travelerâ€™s gender. With this update, TSA allows TSA PreCheck applicants to select their gender based on self-attestation, regardless of the sex assigned at birth. If you are a member of the TSA PreCheck Application Program, you may call (855) 347-8371 weekdays, between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. EDT, to request a gender data update. You may also submit your inquiry online. This new gender marker option will not impact the security screening process. Security screening is conducted without discrimination against travelers based on their race, color, sex, gender, gender identity, national origin, religion or disability. Updating of a travelerâ€™s gender on other identification documents is not required to enroll in TSA PreCheck screening. Travelers will receive TSA PreCheck security screening even if their current gender differs from the gender provided when they enrolled in TSA PreCheck, as long as the name, known traveler number (KTN) and date of birth on their reservation matches their record with TSA. FAQs can be found at the TSA PreCheck Frequently Asked Questions. Making Your Air Travel Reservations When making a reservation, please use the same name and date of birth indicated on your government-issued ID. We also encourage you to provide the gender indicated on your government-issued ID. TSA recommends that travelers contact air carrier customer service if the gender marker on their government-issued ID is not offered in the air carrierâ€™s reservation system. TSA continues to work closely with our domestic air-carrier partners to promote the use and acceptance of the â€œXâ€ gender marker.â€ Currently, two major domestic air carriers already offer â€œXâ€ or undisclosed gender options in their travel-reservation systems, with a third air carrier offering the same in the fall of 2022. Read additional information about identification. Contacting TSA in Advance Prior to a flight, you may contact the TSA Cares helpline at (855) 787-2227 with questions about screening policies and procedures, as well as what to expect as you proceed through the security checkpoint. You may request the assistance of a Passenger Support Specialist, who will provide assistance through the security screening process. While at the Airport Travel Document Checker At the checkpoint, present your government-issued identification and boarding pass to the TSA officer who will ensure the identification and boarding pass are authentic and that the name shown on each document is exactly the same. If the name shown on the identification document does not exactly match the name on the boarding pass, you may need to go to your airline ticket counter for a new boarding pass. TSA has updated its checkpoint procedures to remove gender considerations when validating a travelerâ€™s identification at airport security checkpoints. When travelers appear at the travel-document checker podium for identity verification, gender information is not considered. Go to Security Screening Identification for more information. Inform the TSA Officer All baggage â€“ both checked baggage and carry-on baggage â€“ must go through the screening process. For carry-on baggage - inform the TSA officer if you have medically necessary liquids and/or medications, medical equipment, and/or prostheses, and separate them from other belongings before screening begins. If a bag must be opened by an officer to resolve an alarm, you may ask that the bag be opened and inspected in private. Physical Screening Procedures Passenger screening at the airport is part of TSAâ€™s layered approach to security to get you safely to your destination. Read about various screening measures in place to secure aviation. You will be screened by Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), a walk-through metal detector (WTMD), and/or a pat-down procedure. The AIT Screening Process: Currently, TSAâ€™s AIT units utilize software that relies on gender-specific algorithms and a generic physical outline of the human body that is identical for all passengers. When you enter the imaging portal, the TSA officer will press a button designating your gender as male or female based on the TSA officerâ€™s assessment of how you present. The equipment then conducts a scan and indicates areas on the body warranting further screening, if necessary. If there is an alarm, a TSA officer may show you, on a screen, where the alarm is present. Additional screening, including a pat-down procedure, may be conducted to determine whether a prohibited item is present. AIT Technology Enhancements and Updated Screening Procedures: TSA identified an opportunity to enhance our existing AIT security effectiveness capabilities and simultaneously implement a gender-neutral algorithm. In coordination with the system manufacturer, TSA is in the process of testing this new algorithm. This change will benefit all travelers, including transgender, nonbinary, and other gender-nonconforming travelers who previously have been required to undergo additional screening due to alarms in sensitive areas. Upon completion of successful testing, TSA anticipates initiating deployment of the technology enhancement to airports later this year. Beginning in May 2022, TSA is also updating its screening procedures to better serve transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming travelers through less invasive screening procedures for passengers who trigger the AIT scanner in a sensitive area. This change will reduce the number of pat downs for TSOs and the travelling public without compromising security, and will be in effect until the gender-neutral AIT screening technology is deployed. You may ask for a supervisor at any point during the AIT screening process. Pat-Downs: If there is a screening alarm by technology (i.e., AIT, WTMD), or if you opt-out of screening by technology, a pat-down procedure is performed, and is generally conducted by an officer that is the same gender as the TSA officerâ€™s assessment of how you present. Alternatively, you may choose to inform the officer of your gender identity and make a request that the pat-down be conducted by an officer of that gender. Screening can be conducted in the checkpoint area, or you may request to have a pat-down in private and be accompanied by a companion of your choice. You may bring your carry-on baggage to the private screening area and may request a chair to sit if needed. You will not be asked to remove or lift any article of clothing to reveal sensitive body areas. You may be asked to adjust loose fitting clothing by the TSA officer doing the pat-down procedure. For additional information about the pat-down, see Security Screening. Please also see additional guidance for on body prostheses. Contact Us If you have experienced an inappropriate screening process at a security checkpoint, you may request to speak with a supervisor at the checkpoint. You may also submit your concern to the TSA Contact Center. If you have experienced discrimination, you may email or submit a civil rights complaint.

It simply means their current gender is not the same as the one they were assigned at birth. An illustration of a group of trans people enjoying themselves in a park. Share on PinterestIllustration by Whitney Williams Weâ€™re all expected to grow and change as we get older. We grow taller and wiser, and we come to a deeper understanding of ourselves. For some of us, this deeper understanding comes with the knowledge that weâ€™ve been raised as the wrong gender. When a personâ€™s true gender is different from the one they were assigned at birth, we describe this as being transgender. In this article, we explore what being transgender means and what gender diversity exists under the trans umbrella. What does â€˜transgenderâ€™ mean? The term â€œtransgenderâ€ (trans for short) is one of many adjectives that can be applied to a person. Being trans means you do not identify with the gender you were assigned at birth. It does not indicate what your gender is. The opposite of transgender is cisgender, which indicates that you do identify with the gender you were assigned at birth. Both prefixes â€œcisâ€ and â€œtransâ€ have Latin meanings: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls trans means â€œacross fromâ€ or â€œthe other side ofâ€ aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls cis means â€œon the same sideâ€ or â€œthe same asâ€ â€œTransgenderâ€ is an umbrella term for many different gender identities and expressions. Some people may medically, socially, and legally transition, but doing these things is not a requirement to be transgender. Although the word we use today may not have been used in the past, the idea of being trans or gender nonconforming has always existed in Indigenous, Western, and Eastern cultures. The meanings and attributes of gender, gender expression, and gender roles vary from culture to culture, past and present. Who falls under the transgender umbrella? â€œTransgenderâ€ is an umbrella term, meaning that many different gender identities and expressions are included in this community. For example: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls nonbinary aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls genderfluid aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls genderqueer aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls agender aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls trans man aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls trans woman Itâ€™s possible to also transition to many other genders that arenâ€™t exclusively man or woman, or to a mix of genders at different times, and youâ€™re still part of the community. When was the term â€˜transgenderâ€™ coined? The first recorded use of the word â€œtransgenderâ€ was in the book â€œSexual Hygiene and Pathologyâ€ by John F. Oliven, MD, in 1965. Was this helpful? (BUTTON) (BUTTON) How to use the term â€˜transgenderâ€™ â€œTransgenderâ€ is an adjective. Itâ€™s not a noun. You use it similarly to other adjectives like short, tall, young, or old. If you were describing a woman who was short, you wouldnâ€™t call her â€œa shortâ€; you would likely say â€œa short woman.â€ Likewise, when talking about someone in the transgender community, you donâ€™t call a trans person â€œa trans,â€ â€œa transgender,â€ or â€œa they.â€ When talking about a group, some correct terms to use are â€œtransgender peopleâ€ or â€œthe transgender community.â€ The difference between trans man and trans woman A trans man is a man who is transgender. They were assigned a feminine sex and gender at birth and have since transitioned to a masculine gender. Some people still use â€œFTM (female-to-male)â€ when describing themselves as trans men, but this term is often considered outdated and should not be applied to people without their consent. A trans woman is a woman who is trans. They were assigned a masculine sex and gender at birth and have since transitioned to a feminine gender. They similarly might use the term â€œMTF (male-to-female),â€ but the same concerns about consent apply to this more outdated initialism. Itâ€™s important to remember that these terms are meant to express the gender of the person and not the genitalia you believe they have. To better understand the spectrum of sex and gender (including intersex people), you can check out this article. Transgender or transsexual Most people use â€œtransgenderâ€ in place of â€œtranssexual.â€ â€œTranssexualâ€ is considered an outdated term according to the American Psychological Association style guide, although some people may use it as an identity term for themselves. It should not be used for someone without their consent. You can learn more about the difference between â€œtransgenderâ€ and â€œtranssexualâ€ here. Gender nonconforming vs. transgender Being gender nonconforming means youâ€™re not conforming to the typical gendered standards of your culture (be it your gender expression, gender roles, etc.) at the time. Being transgender is when your gender doesnâ€™t align with the one you were assigned at birth. Sometimes being gender nonconforming coincides with being transgender, but not always. Many gender nonconforming people are cisgender and heterosexual. This idea might seem new, but youâ€™ve likely seen examples of it your entire life: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Someone who is a cis man, straight, and chooses to stay home to take care of their children would be considered gender nonconforming but is not transgender. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls A cisgender woman who chooses to cut their hair short and wear a tuxedo at fancy events would be considered gender nonconforming but is not transgender. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls A trans man who chooses to wear nail polish or makeup is both gender nonconforming and transgender. A personâ€™s gender expression and the labels they use can often differ from your expectations. Sometimes you might see someone you think is more feminine or masculine based on your interpretations of gender, but they might consider themselves something else because of their own views. What about pronouns? While many men (including trans men) use he/him pronouns, many women (trans women included) use she/her pronouns, and many non-binary people use they/them pronouns â€• thatâ€™s not the case for everyone. If youâ€™re unsure what pronouns someone uses, itâ€™s easy to ask them. You can also learn more about pronoun use in this article. Was this helpful? (BUTTON) (BUTTON) Takeaway Being transgender means you experience an incongruence with the gender you were assigned at birth. â€œTransâ€ is also an umbrella term that includes nonbinary, agender, genderqueer, and many other identities not listed here. Regardless of whether you fully understand someoneâ€™s gender, itâ€™s important to respect the terms someone uses to express it.

(BUTTON) Search March 30, 2023 A Proclamation on Transgender Day of Visibility 1. Home 2. Briefing Room 3. Presidential Actions Transgender Day of Visibility celebrates the joy, strength, and absolute courage of some of the bravest people I know â€” people who have too often had to put their jobs, relationships, and lives on the line just to be their true selves. Today, we show millions of transgender and nonbinary Americans that we see them, they belong, and they should be treated with dignity and respect. Their courage has given countless others strength, but no one should have to be brave just to be themselves. Every American deserves that freedom. Transgender Americans shape our Nationâ€™s soul â€” proudly serving in the military, curing deadly diseases, holding elected office, running thriving businesses, fighting for justice, raising families, and much more. As kids, they deserve what every child deserves: the chance to learn in safe and supportive schools, to develop meaningful friendships, and to live openly and honestly. As adults, they deserve the same rights enjoyed by every American, including equal access to health care, housing, and jobs and the chance to age with grace as senior citizens. But today, too many transgender Americans are still denied those rights and freedoms. A wave of discriminatory State laws is targeting transgender youth, terrifying families and hurting kids who are not hurting anyone. An epidemic of violence against transgender women and girls, in particular women and girls of color, has taken lives far too soon. Last yearâ€™s Club Q shooting in Colorado was another painful example of this kind of violence â€” a stain on the conscience of our Nation. My Administration has fought to end these injustices from day one, working to ensure that transgender people and the entire LGBTQI+ community can live openly and safely. On my first day as President, I issued an Executive Order directing the Federal Government to root out discrimination against LGBTQI+ people and their families. We have appointed a record number of openly LGBTQI+ leaders, and I was proud to rescind the ban on openly transgender people serving in the military. We are also working to make public spaces and travel more accessible, including with more inclusive gender markers on United States passports. We are improving access to public services and entitlements like Social Security. We are cracking down on discrimination in housing and education. And last December, I signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law, ensuring that every American can marry the person they love and have that marriage accepted, period. Meanwhile, we are also working to ease the tremendous strain that discrimination, bullying, and harassment can put on transgender children â€” more than half of whom seriously considered suicide in the last year. The Department of Education is, for example, helping ensure that transgender students have equal opportunities to learn and thrive at school, and the Department of Justice is pushing back against extreme laws that seek to ban evidence-based gender-affirming health care. There is much more to do. I continue to call on the Congress to finally pass the Equality Act and extend long-overdue civil rights protections to all LGBTQI+ Americans to ensure they can live with safety and dignity. Together, we also have to keep challenging the hundreds of hateful State laws that have been introduced across the country, making sure every child knows that they are made in the image of God, that they are loved, and that we are standing up for them. America is founded on the idea that all people are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives. We have never fully lived up to that, but we have never walked away from it either. Today, as we celebrate transgender people, we also celebrate every Americanâ€™s fundamental right to be themselves, bringing us closer to realizing Americaâ€™s full promise. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2023, as Transgender Day of Visibility. I call upon all Americans to join us in lifting up the lives and voices of transgender people throughout our Nation and to work toward eliminating violence and discrimination against all transgender, gender nonconforming, and nonbinary people. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-seventh.

Listen here to Founder and Director Stephanie Davies-Arai talking about the harms of gender ideology for children and young people. With thanks to FiLiA charity for this recording. https://static1.squarespace.com/static/559c16dde4b00228d056a5bb/t/5fabc def3153be6fa776b231/1605095417041/Stephanie+Davies-Arai.mp3 â€œWe have failed this generation of kidsâ€. Stephanie Davies-Arai talks to Benjamin Boyce about the new unreality we are living in, what we are doing to kids, the real function of puberty blockers and how The Tavistock Judicial Review has changed the world. Download Transgender Trend is the leading organisation in the call for evidence-based healthcare for children and young people suffering gender dysphoria and for factual, science-based teaching in schools. Our expertise was acknowledged recently when we were granted permission by the High Court to intervene in the Keira Bell v Tavistock &amp; Portman NHS Trust judicial review. Established in 2015, Transgender Trend has led the way in advocating for the rights of children to reject gender stereotypes and be who they really are without discrimination, labelling or medical intervention to â€˜fixâ€™ them. We believe all children have the right to go through puberty and reach adulthood with their fertility intact and that this is a fundamental human right. We believe that children with gender dysphoria deserve evidence-based treatment and have a right to the same duty of care as any other child. Our message is: No child is born in the wrong body. Transgender Trend advocates for the most vulnerable children who are caught up in the recent trend in society to replace the objective reality of sex with the subjective idea of â€˜gender identityâ€™ as the criteria for being a man or being a woman. â€˜Gender identityâ€™ ideology teaches children who donâ€™t conform to masculine or feminine stereotypes that their personalities are â€˜wrongâ€™ for their sex, and their bodies are then â€˜wrongâ€™ for their gender identity. The number of children and young people who now believe they are really the opposite sex is reflected in the unprecedented recent trend in referrals to the Tavistock Gender Identity Development Service. Tavistock referrals Boys and girls should be able to wear what they like and have whatever interests they choose without adult interpretation through the lens of a non-scientific, ideological belief that human beings are born with an innate sense of being male or female, which is inevitably based on sex stereotypes. In school, acceptance of a boy who likes to play with dolls as a girl is no acceptance at all. Acceptance of a lesbian adolescent girl as a straight boy is no acceptance at all. This approach only serves to reinforce restrictive and harmful stereotypes. â€˜Affirmationâ€™ is not kind, it affirms to a child that they are the wrong sex and encourages a childâ€™s belief that their body needs medically changing. Medical intervention can only ever effect cosmetic change; the childâ€™s sex remains the same. We advocate for the rights of lesbian and gay young people to grow up as lesbian or gay. We advocate for the rights of autistic children and those with mental health problems or background trauma to receive proper therapeutic care, not a â€˜diagnosisâ€™ that they are really the opposite sex. All children and young people deserve treatment based on clinical evidence, not ideology. In schools all children deserve to be taught science-based facts, not ideology disguised as â€˜factâ€™. All children have the right to privacy from the opposite sex in toilets and changing-rooms. Policy in schools must always put safeguarding first and schools should not use resources that confuse children about sex. Children should not be coerced into expressing a belief in â€˜gender identityâ€™ through the threat that not to do so is â€˜unkindâ€™ or â€˜transphobicâ€™.

The Daily The Daily | Search The Daily Search website ___________________________ (BUTTON) Search In the news Indicators Releases by subject Special interest Release schedule Information Canada is the first country to provide census data on transgender and non-binary people Text - Selected Tables Related information PDF (588 KB) Released: 2022-04-27 Filling gaps in gender diversity data in Canada Prior to the 2021 Census, some individuals indicated that they were not able to see themselves in the two responses of male or female on the existing sex question in the census. Following extensive consultation and countrywide engagement with the Canadian population, the census evolvedâ€”as it has for more than a centuryâ€”to reflect societal changes, adding new content on gender in 2021. Beginning in 2021, the precision of "at birth" was added to the sex question on the census questionnaire, and a new question on gender was included. As a result, the historical continuity of information on sex was maintained while allowing all cisgender, transgender and non-binary individuals to report their gender. This addressed an important information gap on gender diversity (see Filling the gaps: Information on gender in the 2021 Census and 2021 Census: Sex at birth and genderâ€”the whole picture). For many people, their gender corresponds to their sex at birth (cisgender men and cisgender women). For some, these do not align (transgender men and transgender women) or their gender is not exclusively "man" or "woman" (non-binary people). The strength of the census is to provide reliable data for local communities throughout the country and for smaller populations such as the transgender and non-binary populations. Statistics Canada always protects privacy and confidentiality of respondents when disseminating detailed data. These modifications reflect today's reality in terms of the evolving acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual diversity and an emerging social and legislative recognition of transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people in general, that is, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, or who use other terms related to gender or sexual diversity. In 2017, the Canadian government amended the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Criminal Code to protect individuals from discrimination and hate crimes based on gender identity and expression. These data can be used by public decision makers, employers, and providers of health care, education, justice, and other services to better meet the needs of all men and womenâ€”including transgender men and womenâ€”and non-binary people in their communities. Highlights The 2021 Census of Population included for the first time a question on gender and the precision of "at birth" on the sex question, allowing all cisgender, transgender and non-binary individuals to report their gender. Canada is the first country to collect and publish data on gender diversity from a national census. Of the nearly 30.5 million people in Canada aged 15 and older living in a private household in May 2021, 100,815 were transgender (59,460) or non-binary (41,355), accounting for 0.33% of the population in this age group. The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were three to seven times higher for Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2006, 0.79%) and millennials (born between 1981 and 1996, 0.51%) than for Generation X (born between 1966 and 1980, 0.19%), baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1965, 0.15%) and the Interwar and Greatest Generations (born in 1945 or earlier, 0.12%). Over time, the acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual diversity has evolved. Further, there has been social and legislative recognition of transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people in general. Younger generations may be more comfortable reporting their gender identity than older generations. In May 2021, the Canadian population aged 15 and older had an average age of 48.0 years. In comparison, the transgender population had an average age of 39.4 years, while the non-binary population had an average age of 30.4 years. Just under 1 in 100 young adults aged 20 to 24 were non-binary or transgender (0.85%). Nova Scotia (0.48%), Yukon (0.47%) and British Columbia (0.44%) had the highest proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 and older among provinces and territories. Victoria (0.75%), Halifax (0.66%) and Fredericton (0.60%) had the most gender diversity among Canadian large urban centres. Just over half of non-binary people aged 15 and older (52.7%) lived in one of Canada's six largest urban centres: Toronto (15.3%), MontrÃ©al (11.0%), Vancouver (10.8%), Ottawaâ€“Gatineau (5.6%), Edmonton (5.4%) and Calgary (4.5%). Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary people aged 15 and older (15.5%) lived in the downtown core of a large urban centre. This share was more than twice that of transgender people (7.0%) and over three times higher than that of cisgender people (4.7%). One in 300 people in Canada aged 15 and older are transgender or non-binary Infographic 1 Thumbnail for Infographic 1: One in 300 people in Canada aged 15 and older are transgender or non-binary One in 300 people in Canada aged 15 and older are transgender or non-binary Thumbnail for Infographic 1: One in 300 people in Canada aged 15 and older are transgender or non-binary In May 2021, there were 59,460 people in Canada aged 15 and older living in a private household who were transgender (0.19%) and 41,355 who were non-binary (0.14%). Together, they represented 1 in 300 people, or 0.33% of the population aged 15 and older. Counting transgender people in the 2021 Census and data comparability Canada is the first country to collect and publish data on gender diversity from a national census. While Canada's census data and surveys from other countries are not strictly comparable, they provide valuable insight into gender diversity globally. In Canada, 0.2% of the population aged 18 and older was transgender in 2021. Belgium (0.5% among people aged 18 to 75 in 2021) and New Zealand (0.5% among people aged 18 and older in 2020) have also published representative survey-based data on their transgender populations. Other countries have published 2021 data on transgender people using crowdsourcing and non-representative surveys, including Ireland (0.6% among people aged 18 and older), England and Wales (0.6% among people aged 16 and older), and the United States (0.8% among people aged 18 and older). Among the 59,460 transgender people, there were more transgender women (31,555) than transgender men (27,905). The transgender and non-binary generation gap Chart 1 Chart 1: The transgender and non-binary generation gap The transgender and non-binary generation gap Chart 1: The transgender and non-binary generation gap Over time, the acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual diversity has evolved. Further, there has been social and legislative recognition of transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people in general. Younger generations may be more comfortable reporting their gender identity than older generations. The Canadian population aged 15 and older can be divided into six generations, each born in a different period. The following generations (and their age groups in May 2021) are based on work from the Pew Research Center and existing literature, and are consistent with the Census in Brief: A generational portrait of Canada's aging population from the 2021 Census: Greatest Generation: people aged 94 or older (born before 1928) Interwar Generation: people aged 76 to 93 (born between 1928 and 1945) Baby boomers: people aged 56 to 75 (born between 1946 and 1965) Generation X: people aged 41 to 55 (born between 1966 and 1980) Generation Y (millennials): people aged 25 to 40 (born between 1981 and 1996) Generation Z: people aged 15 to 24 (born between 1997 and 2006) Younger generations had larger shares of those who were transgender or non-binary. The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were three to seven times higher for Generation Z (0.79%) and millennials (0.51%) than for Generation X (0.19%), baby boomers (0.15%) and the Interwar and Greatest Generations (0.12%). Each generation holds attitudes and demonstrates behaviours informed by the historical context in which its members were raised. Generation Z was born in the Internet age, and millennials came of age during a time when the Internet was changing the way we gather and process information. The Internet, along with social media and web-connected personal devices, may have contributed to the increasing awareness of gender diversityâ€”especially among younger generationsâ€”by providing transgender and non-binary individuals with virtual support communities and answers to questions that were less accessible to older generations. Non-binary and transgender people are younger on average than cisgender people Chart 2 Chart 2: Gender diversity is highest among 20- to 24-year-olds Gender diversity is highest among 20- to 24-year-olds Chart 2: Gender diversity is highest among 20- to 24-year-olds In May 2021, the Canadian population aged 15 and older had an average age of 48.0 years. In comparison, the transgender population had an average age of 39.4 years, while the non-binary population had an average age of 30.4 years. Transgender men (34.9 years) were almost a decade younger on average than transgender women (43.3 years). Close to two-thirds (62.0%) of the 100,815 individuals who were transgender or non-binary were younger than 35. Gender diversity was highest among those aged 20 to 24, almost 1 in 100 (0.85%) of whom were transgender or non-binary. In comparison, 1 in 700 were transgender or non-binary among people aged 65 and older. Diversity within gender diversity: Most common terms to describe non-binary gender In this release, the term "non-binary" is used to describe all genders that are neither exclusively man nor woman, although individuals might self-identify with other terms. Gender is experienced in different ways. The 2021 Census asked people to describe their gender via a write-in response so that they could indicate what term was most relevant to them. Terminology related to gender diversity continues to evolve, and the ways to report gender will also continue to evolve. Statistics Canada thanks the Canadian population for contributing to this ongoing discussion. Over two-thirds (70.5%) of people aged 15 and older who provided answers to the write-in option used the term "non-binary" when specifying their gender. Together, over 1 in 6 non-binary people described their gender as "fluid" (7.3%), "agender" (5.1%) or "queer" (4.1%). Other responses included "gender neutral" (2.9%), "Two-Spirit" (2.2%), "neither man nor woman" (1.3%) and "gender-nonconforming" (1.1%). The term "Two-Spirit," which is specific to some Indigenous peoples of North America, was provided in greater proportion by non-binary people living in Western Canada, especially in Manitoba (4.8%) where a large Indigenous population (First Nations people, MÃ©tis and Inuit) resides. Infographic 2 Thumbnail for Infographic 2: Almost one-third of non-binary people describe their gender using terms other than Almost one-third of non-binary people describe their gender using terms other than "non-binary" Thumbnail for Infographic 2: Almost one-third of non-binary people describe their gender using terms other than Among provinces and territories, Nova Scotia, Yukon and British Columbia show the highest proportions of transgender and non-binary individuals Although transgender and non-binary people lived in every province and territory in Canada, they were concentrated in certain areas. Almost 2 in 5 transgender or non-binary people (39.1%) called Ontario home in 2021 (39,450), and this corresponds to Ontario's share of Canada's population aged 15 and older (38.8%). Map 1 Thumbnail for map 1: Canada's most populous province, Ontario, is home to the highest number of transgender and non-binary people Canada's most populous province, Ontario, is home to the highest number of transgender and non-binary people Thumbnail for map 1: Canada's most populous province, Ontario, is home to the highest number of transgender and non-binary people Gender diversity varies by region. Provincially, almost 1 in 200 people living in Nova Scotia (0.48%) and British Columbia (0.44%) were transgender or non-binary, proportions above the national average of 0.33%. Although counts were lower, Yukon (0.47%) also had one of the highest proportions in Canada. Among the provinces, Quebec had the smallest proportions of transgender (0.14%) and non-binary (0.09%) people, followed by Saskatchewan (0.16% and 0.12%, respectively). Chart 3 Chart 3: Approximately 1 in 200 people living in Nova Scotia, Yukon or British Columbia are transgender or non-binary, the highest proportions among provinces and territories Approximately 1 in 200 people living in Nova Scotia, Yukon or British Columbia are transgender or non-binary, the highest proportions among provinces and territories Chart 3: Approximately 1 in 200 people living in Nova Scotia, Yukon or British Columbia are transgender or non-binary, the highest proportions among provinces and territories About 1 in 100 people aged 15 to 34 in Nova Scotia and British Columbia are transgender or non-binary Gender diversity was more common among people aged 15 to 34 than those aged 35 and older. Approximately 1 in 150 people aged 15 to 34 in Canada were transgender or non-binary (0.69%), compared with 1 in 550 people aged 35 and older (0.18%). Nova Scotia (1.17%) and British Columbia (0.90%) had the largest proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 to 34 among provinces, while Quebec (0.52%) and Saskatchewan (0.59%) had the lowest proportions. Among people aged 15 to 34, about 1 in 500 (0.20%) in Canada were transgender men and 1 in 650 (0.15%) were transgender women. The largest proportions of transgender men aged 15 to 34 were found in Nova Scotia (0.33%), New Brunswick (0.26%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (0.26%), while Nova Scotia (0.21%), Newfoundland and Labrador (0.19%), and British Columbia (0.19%) had the largest proportions of transgender women. Moreover, approximately 1 in 300 (0.34%) people aged 15 to 34 in Canada were non-binary. The largest proportion of non-binary people aged 15 to 34 was in Nova Scotia, at 0.63%, followed by British Columbia (0.49%) and New Brunswick (0.39%). Quebec had the lowest proportion in this age group, at 0.25%. Chart 4 Chart 4: Nova Scotia has the highest gender diversity among people aged 15 to 34 among the provinces Nova Scotia has the highest gender diversity among people aged 15 to 34 among the provinces Chart 4: Nova Scotia has the highest gender diversity among people aged 15 to 34 among the provinces The vast majority of non-binary individuals in Canada live in an urban setting Urban living was more popular among non-binary individuals than among transgender and cisgender individuals. In 2021, over 9 in 10 non-binary people aged 15 and older in Canada (92.5%) lived in an urban centre of over 100,000 people, also called a census metropolitan area (CMA), or a mid-sized urban centre of over 10,000 people called a census agglomeration. This proportion was higher than for the Canadian population as a whole (84.1%). Chart 5 Chart 5: Higher proportion of non-binary people in Canada living in urban areas than transgender and cisgender people Higher proportion of non-binary people in Canada living in urban areas than transgender and cisgender people Chart 5: Higher proportion of non-binary people in Canada living in urban areas than transgender and cisgender people Among all CMAs, the largest proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 and older were found in Victoria (0.75%), Halifax (0.66%) and Fredericton (0.60%), on the west and the east coasts of Canada. A number of factors could explain the greater gender diversity in these urban centres. Victoria, Halifax and Fredericton experienced stronger population growth from 2016 to 2021 than the national average. Moreover, in 2021, Halifax (27.6%) and Fredericton (26.0%) had larger proportions of people aged 15 to 34 than the national average (25.0%). All three urban centres are home to several major colleges and universities, and, since students tend to be younger, this could explain the proportionally higher presence of transgender and non-binary people in these urban centres. The three large urban centres with the lowest levels of gender diversity were all found in Quebec: Drummondville (0.17%), Saguenay (0.17%) and Trois-RiviÃ¨res (0.20%). The populations of these urban centres are generally older (Census in Brief: A portrait of Canada's growing population aged 85 and older from the 2021 Census) than those of other Canadian CMAs. Drummondville (22.4%), Saguenay (21.4%) and Trois-RiviÃ¨res (22.5%) had smaller proportions of people aged 15 to 34 than the national average (25.0%). Infographic 3 Thumbnail for Infographic 3: The largest proportions of transgender and non-binary people in large urban centres are observed on the Canadian east and west coasts The largest proportions of transgender and non-binary people in large urban centres are observed on the Canadian east and west coasts Thumbnail for Infographic 3: The largest proportions of transgender and non-binary people in large urban centres are observed on the Canadian east and west coasts Over half of non-binary people live in Canada's six largest urban centres For the majority of non-binary people in Canada aged 15 and older (52.7%), urban living meant residing in one of Canada's six largest urban centres: Toronto (15.3%), MontrÃ©al (11.0%), Vancouver (10.8%), Ottawaâ€“Gatineau (5.6%), Edmonton (5.4%) and Calgary (4.5%). Just under half of transgender women (49.1%) and transgender men (47.0%) aged 15 and older lived in 1 of these 6 largest urban centres, proportions similar to those of cisgender women (47.9%) and cisgender men (47.3%) living in these CMAs. While Quebec had the lowest proportion of transgender and non-binary people among the provinces, almost three-quarters (71.5%) of the non-binary people and over half (54.7%) of the transgender people in Quebec lived in the CMA of MontrÃ©al. By way of comparison, half of all Quebec residents aged 15 and older lived in the MontrÃ©al CMA. The proportion of non-binary people in Quebec living in the MontrÃ©al CMA (71.5%) was higher than the comparable proportions observed in the large urban areas of Vancouver (home to 53.1% of non-binary people in British Columbia) and Toronto (home to 41.3% of non-binary people in Ontario). Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary people live downtown Living in a downtown core was also more popular for non-binary people than for transgender and cisgender people. Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary people aged 15 and older in Canada (15.5%) were living in the downtown of one of the country's 41 CMAs, and 7.3% lived in the downtown of 1 of the 6 largest CMAs. The proportion of non-binary individuals living in one of the CMA downtowns was over twice that of transgender (7.0%) and cisgender (4.7%) individuals. In Canada, approximately 1 in 200 people aged 15 and older living in a CMA downtown were non-binary (0.45%). Comparatively, 1 in 350 people were transgender men (0.13%) or transgender women (0.16%). Fredericton (1.8%), Nanaimo (1.5%) and Halifax (1.5%) had the largest proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 and older living downtown. Several factors could explain the larger share of non-binary people living in downtown cores. First, over one-third of individuals living in a CMA downtown were aged 15 to 34 (37.4%), and gender diversity was more common among people in this age group than among older people. Second, the concentration of numerous postsecondary educational institutions within downtown cores, combined with a more cosmopolitan atmosphere and the greater availability of social spaces and specialized services for transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people more broadly, may also explain the higher presence of non-binary people in the heart of large urban centres. Transgender or non-binary populations have reported poorer mental health outcomes Starting in 2018, Statistics Canada began introducing the new question on gender and the modified question on sex at birth on most health and social surveys. The 2018 Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces was the first large-scale household survey conducted by Statistics Canada to collect information about sex at birth and gender of respondents. It found that 1 in 400 people in Canada aged 15 and older were transgender or non-binary (0.24%). The survey also revealed important differences in victimization, discrimination and mental health by the gender diversity status of respondents. For example, almost two-thirds of transgender and non-binary individuals (65%) reported poor or fair mental health, five times the proportion of those who were cisgender (11%). Transgender and non-binary people were also more likely to have seriously contemplated suicide in their lifetimes than those who were cisgender (45% versus 16%). The 2019 Survey of Postsecondary Faculty and Researchers, conducted among university and college faculty, postdoctoral fellows and PhD students, found that 1.2% of postdoctoral fellows were non-binary, as were 0.7% of PhD students. Approximately 0.2% of university and college faculty were non-binary. Among postsecondary faculty and researchers in 2019, just over 1 in 10 men (11%) experienced unfair treatment or discrimination, compared with 20% of women and 41% of non-binary people. A socioeconomic analysis of the LGBTQ2+ population suggests transgender and non-binary populations may not have had the resources to cope with unexpected financial stress. According to the 2018 Canadian Housing Survey, non-binary individuals were more likely to live in a dwelling requiring major repairs (29%) than men or women (7%). In 2019, Trans PULSE Canada conducted a national community-based survey on the health and well-being of close to 3,000 transgender and non-binary people aged 14 and older, of whom around 800 respondents participated in a COVID-19 survey the following year. Results show that transgender and non-binary participants, who experienced greater levels of economic insecurity and social marginalization before the pandemic, may have been particularly affected. They found that a majority of transgender and non-binary people experienced both negative financial and social impacts from the pandemic. Using crowdsourced data collection, Statistics Canada found important gender differences in the self-perceived mental health of individuals in Canada during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. About two-thirds (68%) of non-binary participants reported fair or poor mental health, compared with just over one-quarter (26%) of women and just over one-fifth (21%) of men who participated in the crowdsource initiative. Looking ahead The 2021 Census release on families, households and marital status, which will take place on July 13, 2022, will include analysis and data tables on couples. In particular, there will be analysis of same-gender and different-gender couples, as well as couples composed of at least one transgender person or at least one non-binary person. Family and household characteristics and sociocultural and socioeconomic data from the 2021 Census released over the next months will continue to enrich the portrait of the transgender and non-binary populations in Canada. Table 1 Distribution of the population aged 15 and older, in private households, by sex, from 1991 to 2016, and sex at birth, in 2021, Canada Table 2 Distribution of the population aged 15 and older, in private households, by gender, 2021, Canada Note to readers The Canadian population is encouraged to download the StatsCAN app to view the census results. Definitions, concepts and geography In April 2018, Statistics Canada published new metadata standards for sex at birth and gender to better reflect the way the Canadian population self-identifies. Throughout the winter of 2021, Statistics Canada held a public consultation on the update to the gender standard to ensure it remains relevant and meaningful for the communities of interest. The standards on sex at birth and gender were modified to reflect feedback received during this consultation. The updated standards were published in October 2021, and a "What we heard" report summarizing comments received during the public consultation will be published in the coming months. The sex at birth standard provides a classification variant with three categories (male, female and intersex). However, for reasons related to the small size of the intersex population and the challenges in identifying intersex people, Statistics Canada does not currently collect specific information on intersex people in Canada. Tables 1 and 2 present distributions of the Canadian population aged 15 and older living in a private household by sex according to data from the 1991 to 2016 censuses and sex at birth and gender using 2021 Census data. In 2021, the number of people whose sex was male was very similar to the number of men. The same was observed among people whose sex was female compared with women. These similarities can be explained by the relatively small size of the transgender and non-binary populations. Moreover, the distribution of the population aged 15 and older in private households by sex (from 1991 to 2016) and sex at birth (in 2021) was very similar between census years. In this article, certain gender non-binary terms were grouped based on their similarities (e.g., "genderqueer," "queer man" and "queer woman" are all included in the estimate of "queer"). For more information on collection and processing methods of responses to the "specify" option for the gender question, please refer to the Age, Sex at Birth and Gender Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021. The term "Two-Spirit" is specific to some Indigenous peoples of North America (see gender classification). However, the Indigenous identity of individuals was not taken into account when coding answers to the "specify" option for the gender question. The number of "Two-Spirit" answers may be smaller if only Indigenous individuals were included. The definitions for terms describing non-binary gender are included in the Gender and Sexual Diversity Glossary, published by the Translation Bureau. In this release, the analysis of gender diversity results is limited to the population aged 15 and older even though the question was asked regardless of age, as children aged 14 and younger may not be fully aware of their gender identity or may not have defined it yet. In the Census in brief: A generational portrait of Canada's aging population from the 2021 Census, Generation Z is defined as people born between 1997 and 2012 and aged 9 to 24 in May 2021. In this article, since the analysis is focused on the population aged 15 and older, Generation Z is redefined as those born between 1997 and 2006 and aged 15 to 24 in May 2021. To ensure the confidentiality of responses collected for the 2021 Census, a random rounding process is used to alter the values of released data. As a result, when these data are summed or grouped, the total value may not match the sum of the individual values, since the total and subtotals are independently rounded. Similarly, percentage distributions, which are calculated on rounded data, may not necessarily add up to 100%. 2021 Census of Population products and releases Today, Statistics Canada is releasing the second set of results from the 2021 Census of Population. Several 2021 Census products are also available today on the 2021 Census Program web module. This web module has been designed to provide easy access to census data, free of charge. Analytical products include two releases in The Daily and two articles in the Census in Brief series. Data products include the sex at birth and gender, as well as age and type of dwelling results for a wide range of standard geographic areas, available through the Census Profile and data tables. Focus on Geography provides data and highlights on key topics found in this Daily release and in the Census in Brief articles at various levels of geography. Reference materials are designed to help users make the most of census data. They include the Guide to the Census of Population, 2021, the Dictionary, Census of Population, 2021, and the 2021 Census of Population questionnaires. Both the dictionary and the guide are updated with additional information throughout the release cycle. The Type of Dwelling Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021 and Age, Sex at Birth and Gender Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021 are also available. A fact sheet on gender concepts, Filling the gaps: Information on gender in the 2021 Census, is also available.

Sheâ€™s worked with public institutions in her home state of Michigan to protect access to education for women and marginalized students. And sheâ€™s taken on some of the most entrenched societal failures, from food insecurity to lack of economic opportunity, that are holding girls and women back around the world. She shares how her experiences as a disabled, marginalized, and minority woman entrepreneur have shaped and inspired her lifelong efforts to ensure women of all backgrounds have access to education and opportunity. What first motivated you to become an advocate for girls and women? My first experience with advocacy was in 1989, when I was the student government president at Highland Park Community College. At the time it was the only HBCU (historically Black colleges and universities) in Michigan, and women made up a majority of the student body. Highland Park was a vital institution of higher education, offering underserved communities in the Detroit area opportunities to further their education and build careers, especially in the medical field; it was home to a top-graduating nursing program. Unfortunately, the school was experiencing financial and administrative challenges, and by the time I was serving on student government, Highland Park was on the brink of closure. So I worked directly with the Michigan Board of Education to keep the school open for as long as possible. It was intimidating to speak before a big institution like the Board of Education as a young student, but I was determined to keep the school open. If Highland Park had shut its doors then, the most marginalized students â€” those who were low income or homeless, physically disabled, or lacked access to technology at home â€” would have been the most severely affected. In the end, I managed to help keep Michiganâ€™s top-graduating two-year HBCU open for several more years. Sadly, the school ultimately closed, but I am proud that I was able to help more women and marginalized students change their socioeconomic trajectories in those final years. Being the voice of my community â€” representing Highland Park Community College â€” before a massive institution was a turning point for me. I realized that I could have a seat at the proverbial table. From that point on, I realized that I could help make a difference for those who were most at risk of being left behind. My passion for advancing equality â€” especially gender equality â€” grew from there. And just as important, it helped me to see that making a real difference means overcoming more than one obstacle. It takes persistence to knock down barrier after barrier to progress. Achieving a gender-equal world means repealing discriminatory laws and practices, educating, protecting, and promoting the rights of girls and women at every turn. â€œAchieving a gender-equal world means repealing discriminatory laws and practices, educating, protecting, and promoting the rights of girls and women at every turn.â€ -Lady Tee Thompson How did you find the courage and the confidence to represent students before the stateâ€™s Board of Education? I had a fantastic mentor: Congressman John Conyers Jr. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives for over half a century and remains the longest-serving African American member of the House. He taught me how to effectively advocate against a huge institution like the Michigan Board of Education, and he personally taught me about equality, equity, and inclusion. As a champion for justice and equality himself, Congressman Conyers helped me understand that we all have a civic duty to eliminate discrimination, even â€” and especially â€” if that means going up against institutions or harmful norms in our societies. That is how progress happens for all of us. That is how we can ensure equality for everyone, everywhere. Thatâ€™s a valuable perspective, especially since progress on gender equality has been slow, stagnant, and set back by recent crises. Where have you found progress since your time at Highland Park? Over the past two decades, Iâ€™ve shifted from local to global advocacy with a focus on supporting women entrepreneurs around the world. I had a pivotal moment in 2015 after speaking at a womenâ€™s empowerment conference in West Africa. Several of the women I met were leading farming cooperatives and shared that they not only lacked land rights, but they couldnâ€™t receive the training they needed to scale up their businesses â€” just because they were women. Ninety days later, I launched an agricultural and entrepreneur training firm: AgroBiz.org. To date, we have mentored over 50,000 girls and women across the U.S. and 14 other countries. Our support takes a variety of forms, from bringing women farmers from Africa to the U.S. for learning tours to educational programming on everything from precision agriculture to launching and growing microenterprises. Economic empowerment and food security are two sides of the same coin, and both are essential to gender equality. In fact, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of hungry people in the world could fall by as much as 150 million if women farmers were guaranteed access to the same resources as men. How has your engagement with the United Nations Association of the USA (UNA-USA) contributed to your gender advocacy efforts? Joining UNA-USA was a natural fit. As the current co-Chair of the Womenâ€™s Affinity Group, Iâ€™m empowered to directly discuss and challenge systemic gender inequalities and inequities. And as a Global Goals Ambassador, Iâ€™ve been able to continue advocating for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in new ways and places. Lady Tee speaks at a womenâ€™s empowerment conference in West Africa. Through her advocacy efforts, Lady Tee Thompson is working to accelerate progress across the Sustainable Development Goals â€” from quality education (SDG4) to gender equality (SDG5) to decent work and economic growth (SDG8). Photo: Lady Tee Thompson For example, I traveled to Kwara State in Nigeria in early 2023 where I visited a local company run by KAM Holdings that manufactures steel nails. The best part? Itâ€™s an all-women workforce, and their manufacturing process produces zero steel waste. Itâ€™s a great example of how progress on one SDG unlocks progress across the entire framework, in this case, from Gender Equality (SDG 5) to Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8) to Sustainable Consumption and Production (SDG 12). Seeing how innovative they were in order to ensure zero steel manufacturing waste and align their work with the SDGs was encouraging. But it was their dedication to the economic empowerment of women in their community that rejuvenated my soul and reaffirmed my faith that equality everywhere is possible. What does #EqualEverywhere mean to you? It means bringing a global, gender-specific lens to our laws, cultural norms, homes, workplaces, and communities. It means accounting for girls and women â€” and especially marginalized women â€” in everything we do, and everywhere we do it. Itâ€™s the only way we can build truly inclusive communities and societies. And weâ€™ll be able to do it only if everyone is an advocate for gender equality. Get Involved If Lady Teeâ€™s story inspired you, join the movement for gender equalityâ€”and share your commitment to making girls and women #EqualEverywhere.

Answers to your questions about transgender people, gender identity, and gender expression. https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbtq/transgender-people-gender-identity-gen der-expression Comment: ____________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________ two transgender individuals standing next to each other According to the APA Style guide, the term â€œtranssexualâ€ is largely outdated, but some people identify with it; this term should be used only for an individual who specifically claims it. While the term â€œtranssexualâ€ appears multiple times throughout this document, APAâ€™s Committee on Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity is undertaking a systematic review of its use along with other terms. In the meantime, please refer to the Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People (PDF, 472KB) for more up-to-date language regarding transgender and gender nonconforming people. Transgender is an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth. Gender identity refers to a personâ€™s internal sense of being male, female or something else; gender expression refers to the way a person communicates gender identity to others through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, voice or body characteristics. â€œTransâ€ is sometimes used as shorthand for â€œtransgender.â€ While transgender is generally a good term to use, not everyone whose appearance or behavior is gender-nonconforming will identify as a transgender person. The ways that transgender people are talked about in popular culture, academia and science are constantly changing, particularly as individualsâ€™ awareness, knowledge and openness about transgender people and their experiences grow. What is the difference between sex and gender? Sex is assigned at birth, refers to oneâ€™s biological status as either male or female, and is associated primarily with physical attributes such as chromosomes, hormone prevalence, and external and internal anatomy. Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for boys and men or girls and women. These influence the ways that people act, interact, and feel about themselves. While aspects of biological sex are similar across different cultures, aspects of gender may differ. Various conditions that lead to atypical development of physical sex characteristics are collectively referred to as intersex conditions. Have transgender people always existed? Transgender persons have been documented in many indigenous, Western, and Eastern cultures and societies from antiquity until the present day. However, the meaning of gender nonconformity may vary from culture to culture. What are some categories or types of transgender people? Many identities fall under the transgender umbrella. The term transsexual refers to people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex. Often, transsexual people alter or wish to alter their bodies through hormones, surgery, and other means to make their bodies as congruent as possible with their gender identities. This process of transition through medical intervention is often referred to as sex or gender reassignment, but more recently is also referred to as gender affirmation. People who were assigned female, but identify and live as male and alter or wish to alter their bodies through medical intervention to more closely resemble their gender identity are known as transsexual men or transmen (also known as female-to-male or FTM). Conversely, people who were assigned male, but identify and live as female and alter or wish to alter their bodies through medical intervention to more closely resemble their gender identity are known as transsexual women or transwomen (also known as male-to-female or MTF). Some individuals who transition from one gender to another prefer to be referred to as a man or a woman, rather than as transgender. People who cross-dress wear clothing that is traditionally or stereotypically worn by another gender in their culture. They vary in how completely they cross-dress, from one article of clothing to fully cross-dressing. Those who cross-dress are usually comfortable with their assigned sex and do not wish to change it. Cross-dressing is a form of gender expression and is not necessarily tied to erotic activity. Cross-dressing is not indicative of sexual orientation. (See Answers to Your Questions: For a Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality for more information on sexual orientation.) The degree of societal acceptance for cross-dressing varies for males and females. In some cultures, one gender may be given more latitude than another for wearing clothing associated with a different gender. The term drag queens generally refers to men who dress as women for the purpose of entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events. The term drag kings refers to women who dress as men for the purpose of entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events. Genderqueer is a term that some people use who identify their gender as falling outside the binary constructs of â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemale.â€ They may define their gender as falling somewhere on a continuum between male and female, or they may define it as wholly different from these terms. They may also request that pronouns be used to refer to them that are neither masculine nor feminine, such as â€œzieâ€ instead of â€œheâ€ or â€œshe,â€ or â€œhirâ€ instead of â€œhisâ€ or â€œher.â€ Some genderqueer people do not identify as transgender. Other categories of transgender people include androgynous, multigendered, gender nonconforming, third gender, and two-spirit people. Exact definitions of these terms vary from person to person and may change over time, but often include a sense of blending or alternating genders. Some people who use these terms to describe themselves see traditional, binary concepts of gender as restrictive. Why are some people transgender? There is no single explanation for why some people are transgender. The diversity of transgender expression and experiences argues against any simple or unitary explanation. Many experts believe that biological factors such as genetic influences and prenatal hormone levels, early experiences, and experiences later in adolescence or adulthood may all contribute to the development of transgender identities. How prevalent are transgender people? It is difficult to accurately estimate the number of transgender people, mostly because there are no population studies that accurately and completely account for the range of gender identity and gender expression. What is the relationship between gender identity and sexual orientation? Gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same. Sexual orientation refers to an individualâ€™s enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to another person, whereas gender identity refers to oneâ€™s internal sense of being male, female, or something else. Transgender people may be straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or asexual, just as nontransgender people can be. Some recent research has shown that a change or a new exploration period in partner attraction may occur during the process of transition. However, transgender people usually remain as attached to loved ones after transition as they were before transition. Transgender people usually label their sexual orientation using their gender as a reference. For example, a transgender woman, or a person who is assigned male at birth and transitions to female, who is attracted to other women would be identified as a lesbian or gay woman. Likewise, a transgender man, or a person who is assigned female at birth and transitions to male, who is attracted to other men would be identified as a gay man. How does someone know that they are transgender? Transgender people experience their transgender identity in a variety of ways and may become aware of their transgender identity at any age. Some can trace their transgender identities and feelings back to their earliest memories. They may have vague feelings of â€œnot fitting inâ€ with people of their assigned sex or specific wishes to be something other than their assigned sex. Others become aware of their transgender identities or begin to explore and experience gender-nonconforming attitudes and behaviors during adolescence or much later in life. Some embrace their transgender feelings, while others struggle with feelings of shame or confusion. Those who transition later in life may have struggled to fit in adequately as their assigned sex only to later face dissatisfaction with their lives. Some transgender people, transsexuals in particular, experience intense dissatisfaction with their sex assigned at birth, physical sex characteristics, or the gender role associated with that sex. These individuals often seek gender-affirming treatments. What should parents do if their child appears to be transgender or gender nonconforming? Parents may be concerned about a child who appears to be gender-nonconforming for a variety of reasons. Some children express a great deal of distress about their assigned sex at birth or the gender roles they are expected to follow. Some children experience difficult social interactions with peers and adults because of their gender expression. Parents may become concerned when what they believed to be a â€œphaseâ€ does not pass. Parents of gender-nonconforming children may need to work with schools and other institutions to address their childrenâ€™s particular needs and ensure their childrenâ€™s safety. It is helpful to consult with mental health and medical professionals familiar with gender issues in children to decide how to best address these concerns. It is not helpful to force the child to act in a more gender-conforming way. Peer support from other parents of gender-nonconforming children may also be helpful. How do transgender individuals make a gender transition? Transitioning from one gender to another is a complex process and may involve transition to a gender that is neither traditionally male nor female. People who transition often start by expressing their preferred gender in situations where they feel safe. They typically work up to living full time as members of their preferred gender by making many changes a little at a time. While there is no â€œrightâ€ way to transition genders, there are some common social changes transgender people experience that may involve one or more of the following: adopting the appearance of the desired sex through changes in clothing and grooming, adopting a new name, changing sex designation on identity documents (if possible), using hormone therapy treatment, and/or undergoing medical procedures that modify their body to conform with their gender identity. Every transgender personâ€™s process or transition differs. Because of this, many factors may determine how the individual wishes to live and express their gender identity. Finding a qualified mental health professional who is experienced in providing affirmative care for transgender people is an important first step. A qualified professional can provide guidance and referrals to other helping professionals. Connecting with other transgender people through peer support groups and transgender community organizations is also helpful. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), a professional organization devoted to the treatment of transgender people, publishes The Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders, which offers recommendations for the provision of gender affirmation procedures and services. Is being transgender a mental disorder? A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria." Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as "gender identity disorder." What kinds of discrimination do transgender people face? Anti-discrimination laws in most U.S. cities and states do not protect transgender people from discrimination based on gender identity or gender expression. Consequently, transgender people in most cities and states face discrimination in nearly every aspect of their lives. The National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force released a report in 2011 entitled Injustice at Every Turn, which confirmed the pervasive and severe discrimination faced by transgender people. Out of a sample of nearly 6,500 transgender people, the report found that transgender people experience high levels of discrimination in employment, housing, health care, education, legal systems, and even in their families. Transgender people may also have additional identities that may affect the types of discrimination they experience. Groups with such additional identities include transgender people of racial, ethnic, or religious minority backgrounds; transgender people of lower socioeconomic statuses; transgender people with disabilities; transgender youth; transgender elderly; and others. Experiencing discrimination may cause significant amounts of psychological stress, often leaving transgender individuals to wonder whether they were discriminated against because of their gender identity or gender expression, another sociocultural identity, or some combination of all of these. According to the study, while discrimination is pervasive for the majority of transgender people, the intersection of anti-transgender bias and persistent, structural racism is especially severe. People of color in general fare worse than White transgender people, with African American transgender individuals faring far worse than all other transgender populations examined. Many transgender people are the targets of hate crimes. They are also the victims of subtle discriminationâ€”which includes everything from glances or glares of disapproval or discomfort to invasive questions about their body parts.

A transgender woman playing the drums. Share on PinterestElisabeth Ubbe/Getty Images The National Center for Transgender Equality defines transgender people as those who have a different gender identity to their assigned gender at birth. Some people may also use â€œtransâ€ as a shortened version for transgender. Gender identity is the innate knowledge of who a person is. Every person has a gender identity, which may match their assigned sex at birth, or it may be different. A healthcare professional usually assigns newborns either a male or female sex at birth. If people identify with a different gender to the one they were assigned, they may describe themselves as transgender. A transgender woman is someone who is currently living as a woman but was assigned a male sex at birth. A transgender man is someone who is currently living as a man but was assigned a female sex at birth. Some transgender people may not identify with being either male or female, or may identify as a combination of male and female. Other terms people may use to describe their gender identity include nonbinary or genderqueer. How would a person know if they are transgender? People may realize they are transgender at any age. Planned Parenthood notes that many people know they are transgender from a young age, and others may not realize until later in life. People may have a feeling of not fitting in, or may feel uncomfortable emotions when talking about their gender or being seen by others as a gender they do not identify with. A person can try the following to help them understand their gender identity: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Write about how they feel in a journal on a regular basis. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Talk about their feelings with people they trust. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Talk about their feelings with a therapist or counselor. A person can also try to learn about other transgender peopleâ€™s experiences. They can do this through reading literature written by transgender people or meeting transgender people in person. It may be possible to find helpful LGBTQIA+ resources and support groups either in the community or at school or university. Transgender and gender dysphoria Some transgender people may experience severe emotional distress if there is a difference between their gender identity and assigned sex at birth. The medical term for this is gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria can affect a personâ€™s health, well-being, and everyday life. By aligning with and expressing their gender identity, people may be able to resolve gender dysphoria. The American Psychiatric Association notes that gender dysphoria often begins in childhood. However, some people may not experience it until puberty or later in life. What to know about transitioning Transitioning is the term people use for the period of time when they align themselves and their life with their true gender identity, rather than their assigned sex at birth. Transitioning is not necessary to be transgender, although many transgender people choose to transition at some point. There are no set steps or criteria for transitioning, and it is individual for each person. Steps some people may or may not take to transition can include: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls changing their appearance, such as clothing and hairstyle aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls changing their name aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls changing pronouns aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls changing official documents to reflect their gender identity aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls hormone therapy to change physical characteristics aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls medical procedures to change physical characteristics Some people may also decide to take puberty blockers. For some, the changes that occur during puberty do not align with their gender identity. These block the hormones that lead to puberty, which stops periods, breast growth, facial hair growth, and voice-deepening. According to the Gender Identity Development Service, hormone blockers only last for as long as a person is taking the medication. If a person stops taking them and providing that no other interventions have occurred, they will go through puberty. Gender-affirming hormones Some transgender people may choose to take gender-affirming hormones. These are hormones that create physical changes in the body to align with a personâ€™s gender identity. People may take testosterone to develop masculine characteristics or estrogen to develop feminine characteristics. Gender-affirming surgery Some transgender people may choose to have gender-affirming surgery. People may choose to have surgery that alters their face, chest, or anatomy to align with their gender identity.

What is the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity? Sexual orientation differs from gender identity. Sexual orientation focuses on who people are attracted to. People of any gender identity can have any sexual orientation. Learn more about different types of sexual orientations here. Gender identity is a personâ€™s innate knowledge of their gender. People may identify as a man, woman, nonbinary person, or another gender identity. Learn more about different types of gender identities here. What is the difference between transgender and intersex? The Intersex Society of North America defines intersex as â€œa general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesnâ€™t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male.â€ Sex chromosomes determine the biological sex of a baby. Intersex people may have chromosomes typical to a male or female but have no internal or external anatomy that corresponds to biological male or female anatomy. Transgender people are usually born with genetics and anatomy that match a biological definition of male or female. Transgender people may feel they have a different gender identity to their assigned sex at birth. Learn more about what it means to be intersex here. What is the difference between transgender and gender nonconforming? A person who is gender nonconforming does not conform to the stereotypical ideas of gender. The LGBTQIA Resource Center notes that people more commonly use the term to refer to gender expression instead of gender identity. People may choose to appear and behave in ways that are more â€œmasculineâ€ or â€œfeminineâ€ than society may stereotypically associate with their gender. Someone who is gender nonconforming may or may not be transgender. Transgender people may be gender nonconforming or they may conform to the gender stereotypes of the gender they identify with. Transgender and nonbinary People may describe themselves as nonbinary if they do not identify with either a male or female gender. Nonbinary people may not feel they fit into the gender binary of being a man or a woman. People may also use the term genderqueer to describe their gender identity. Nonbinary people may identify with elements of being both male and female, a different gender, or no gender. Some people may have a fluid gender that changes over time. Transgender people may be nonbinary, but many transgender people identify as either a man or a woman. Learn more about being nonbinary here.

If appropriate, people can also ask which terms a person wants others to use to describe their gender identity. Many transgender people may identify as a man or a woman. Learn more about gender pronouns here. Terminology to avoid Certain words or phrases can be very disrespectful or offensive to transgender people. According to GLAAD, terminology to avoid includes: Terminology to avoid Preferred terminology Reason a transgender or transgenders transgender people or a transgender person Transgender is an adjective, not a noun. transgendered transgender Adding â€œ-edâ€ adds confusion and is grammatically incorrect. transgenderism being transgender Anti-transgender activists use the term â€œtransgenderismâ€ to dehumanize transgender people. sex change, pre-operative, or postoperative transition Using these terms implies that a person must have surgery to be transgender. sex change surgery or sex reassignment gender-affirming surgery With surgery, the person is not changing their sex, but altering their body to better match their gender. â€¢ biologically or genetically male or female â€¢ born a man or woman â€¢ assigned or designated male at birth â€¢ assigned or designated female at birth A number of factors determine a personâ€™s sex. These terms oversimplify a complex subject. passing or stealth â€¢ visibly transgender â€¢ not visibly transgender The terms imply that transgender people are deceiving.

Summary The term transgender refers to those who do not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth. A person can realize they are transgender at any point in life. Transitioning is a term people use to refer to the steps a person can take to align themselves with their true gender identity. This can involve changing their pronouns, taking gender-affirming hormones, and undergoing gender-affirming surgery. However, transitioning is not necessary to be transgender. To be an ally, people can use correct pronouns and avoid using offensive terminology. They can also support appropriate campaigns and listen to transgender peopleâ€™s experiences.

His stepdaughter is transgender. (Getty/Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times) Introduction and summary Authorâ€™s note: â€œTransgenderâ€ is an umbrella term used to describe people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differ based on the sex they were assigned at birth.^1 The transgender community is not a monolith. Transgender people have diverse sexual orientations, gender expressions, and gender identities, and transgender identities do not depend on physical appearance or medical procedures. Discrimination, stigma, and violence, along with other social, political, and economic factors, significantly affect the physical, mental, and behavioral health of transgender adults.^2 Research demonstrates that, compared with the general population, transgender people suffer from more chronic health conditions and experience higher rates of health problems related to HIV/AIDS, substance use, mental illness, and sexual and physical violence, as well as higher prevalence and earlier onset of disabilities that can also lead to health issues.^3 In addition to poorer health outcomes, transgender people also encounter unique challenges and inequalities in their ability to access health insurance and adequate care.^4 The public health and economic crises spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic have only exacerbated existing disparities and barriers to care for transgender people, especially transgender people of color.^5 ____________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ [ ] InProgress Stay informed on the most pressing issues of our time. ____________________ (BUTTON) Sign Up This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. While robust laws that protect transgender people from discrimination based on gender identity are essential to providing greater legal safeguards, such tools must be paired with enforcement mechanisms and in-practice policies that are affirming, inclusive, and culturally competent. Adopting both nondiscrimination laws and inclusive policies will be critical for improving health outcomes and the daily lives of the estimated 1.4 million^6 adults identifying as transgender in the United States. To examine the health conditions that transgender adults face, this report incorporates storytelling to elevate their lived experiences. The following sections highlight: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls The status of the physical, behavioral, and mental health of transgender communities and barriers to accessing general and gender-affirming care aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls The contemporary landscape of legal and regulatory nondiscrimination protections in health care aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls In-practice policies to promote affirming, inclusive, and culturally competent care Health status of and barriers to care for transgender communities Transgender individuals are a high-risk population for mental and physical health problems and are consistently and systemically underserved by the American medical system.^7 Regular harassment and discrimination contribute to high rates of stress andâ€”combined with adverse social, political, and economic risk factorsâ€”make transgender individuals significantly more likely to experience poor health outcomes. Structural, institutional, and individual barriers in access to care, along with a lack of cultural competency from many health care providers, contribute to the large disparities in health between transgender and cisgender populations. For example, according to 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, 3 in 5 transgender respondents report experiencing poor mental health at least one day in the past monthâ€”a rate 23 percentage points higher than that of cisgender respondents. (see Figure 1) Fifty-four percent report poor physical health at least one day in the past monthâ€”a rate 18 percentage points higher than that of cisgender respondents. Transgender populations also face an increased likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease^8 as well as a higher likelihood of having asthma,^9 and their rates of chronic depression are more than twice that of cisgender populations.^10 Transgender respondents are significantly more likely to be living with HIV.^11 New research from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law on the first transgender population-based national dataset developed through the TransPop study shows that 7 percent^12 of transgender respondents have at some point been told by a doctor that they have a sexually transmitted infection (STI), compared with 2 percent of heterosexual cisgender respondents. (see Appendix A for more details) Figure 1 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gdL5J Figure 2 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/I1p5H The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated these existing disparities. Elevated rates of asthma, regular smoking, and HIV among transgender populations make them more prone than the general population to experience a severe case of COVID-19.^13 For example, CAP analysis of 2019 BRFSS data shows that 22 percent of transgender individuals have been told they have asthma, compared with 14 percent of cisgender individuals. One international survey of transgender individuals during the pandemic found that 50 percent of respondents had risk factors for a severe course of a COVID-19 infection.^14 Evidence demonstrates that the economic and social inequalities felt by transgender individuals also make them less able to access quality care^15 and more likely to encounter the coronavirus due to factors such as overrepresentation in industries highly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants and food services; hospitals; K-12 education; colleges and universities; and retail.^16 Isolation during the pandemic has also been particularly damaging to the mental health of transgender populations, who already face higher rates of mental health disparities,^17 and 1 in 3 reported having suicidal thoughts during the pandemic.^18 One in 2 reported that their access to gender-affirming health care was curtailed significantly during the pandemic,^19 and this reduced access to necessary care has also been detrimental to mental health.^20 Health effects of minority stress High rates of mental and physical health conditions among transgender people^21 can be partly explained under a â€œminority stressâ€ model, a well-supported theory^22 that for minorities within a society, stigma, prejudice, and discrimination create a hostile and stressful social environment that can contribute to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and drive higher prevalence of unhealthy or high-risk behaviors.^23 According to a nationally representative survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and other sexual and gender-diverse individuals (LGBTQI+) conducted by the Center for American Progress,^24 2 in 3 transgender individuals have experienced some form of discrimination in the year prior, including 65 percent of transgender people of color.^25 The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, found that 46 percent of transgender individuals reported verbal harassment due to their gender identity in the past year,^26 while nearly 1 in 10 reported being physically attacked in the past year. Both numbers increase significantly for Black, Middle Eastern, and American Indian transgender populations.^27 TransPop data^28 show extensive discrimination in the day-to-day lives of transgender respondents. Thirty-eight percent of transgender respondents reported that they were often or sometimes called names or insulted in the past year,^29 compared with 14 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. (see Figure 3) Twenty-eight percent ^30 also reported that they were often or sometimes threatened or harassed, compared with 10 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. These experiences were compounded by disproportionately high rates of mistreatment and disrespect from others: 35 percent reported often or sometimes receiving poorer service at restaurants or stores, and 63 percent reported that people sometimes or often acted as though they were better than them,^31 compared with 15 percent and 37 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents, respectively. Figure 3 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vBsRc On a psychological level, stress from such experiences leads to the dysregulation of cortisol, which affects a wide range of bodily functions, including oneâ€™s metabolism, mood, cardiovascular health, and immune system health.^32 Experiences of discrimination have been linked to high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder,^33 lack of body satisfaction,^34 depression,^35 anxiety, and psychological distress.^36 Most alarmingly, such experiences have been connected to both nonsuicidal self-injury^37 and attempted suicide: 42 percent of transgender individuals reported attempting suicide to cope with transgender-related discrimination.^38 Data from the TransPop survey reveal disparities in suicidal behavior between transgender and cisgender heterosexual individuals in terms of contemplating suicide during their lifetime (81 percent^39 versus 30 percent); attempting suicide in their lifetime (42 percent^40 versus 8 percent); and engaging in nonsuicidal self-injury (56 percent^41 versus 9 percent). (see Figure 4) Figure 4 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2KAoz In addition to physical ailments and psychological harms, experiences of discrimination have been extensively linked to high rates of substance use. Transgender individuals who report experiencing high levels of discrimination are 3.59 times more likely to engage in binge drinking^42 than transgender individuals who report low levels of discrimination.^43 CAP analysis of data from the BRFSS shows that 59 percent of transgender individuals report smoking tobacco some days or every day, compared with 39 percent of cisgender individuals.^44 (see Figure 5) TransPop data also show large disparities in drug use: 25 percent of transgender respondents report using drugs other than alcohol at least twice a month, compared with 10 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. Discriminatory experiences have also been linked to difficulty engaging in healthy life practices, which is compounded by economic difficulties.^45 BRFSS data reveal that transgender adults reported exercising in the past month at a rate of 8 percent lower than cisgender respondents; were 9 percent less likely to consume at least one fruit a day; and were 11 percent less likely to consume at least one vegetable a day. (see Figure 6) Figure 5 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3AA2i Figure 6 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/U6wFE Gender-based violence and hate violence The threat or presence of violence represents an additional determinant of health for many transgender people. In addition to causing physical injuries, the presence of violence against transgender people in many environments contributes to minority stress and mental health consequences. Lethal violence is widespread, and reported killings are increasing annually: In the United States, 29 transgender or gender-nonconforming people have been reported killed in 2021 so far, and 44 were killed in 2020.^46 The true number is likely higher, as law enforcement and media often do not accurately identify victims.^47 Black and Latina transgender women are consistently and drastically overrepresented among victims. Awareness and fear of potential victimization contribute to the many stresses that transgender people already face. This fear is justified by not only the possibility of lethal violence but also the ubiquity of nonlethal violence. The TransPop survey found that 48 percent of transgender adults in the United States have been beaten, physically attacked, or sexually assaulted at least once since the age of 18^48â€”a rate 12 percentage points higher than that of cisgender heterosexual people. (see Figure 7) Nearly half of those transgender respondents experienced such violence three or more times. Sixty-one percent of transgender people reported being threatened with violence, and 76 percent reported verbal insults or abuse.^49 Violence takes many forms. According to the TransPop survey, 32 percent of transgender people report experiencing intimate partner violence,^50 a rate 7 percentage points higher than that of cisgender heterosexual people. Among cases of transgender women killed in the U.S. between 2015 and 2020, almost half of identified suspects were intimate partners, a category taken to include romantic partners, sex work clients, and other relationships.^51 Even with less than 15 percent of law enforcement departments nationwide reporting hate crime data, 227 crimes motivated at least in part by gender identity bias were recorded by the FBI in 2019, including intimidation, vandalism, and simple and aggravated assault.^52 Violence also occurs in many settings: A Washington, D.C., survey found that perpetrators of physical assault against transgender people include co-workers, students and school staff, police, incarcerated people and prison staff, and shelter residents or staff.^53 Violence has serious health consequences, both physical and mental. Estimates of the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in transgender population samples range from 18 percent to 61 percent, compared with 6.8 percent among the general adult population.^54 Figure 7 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MGkqp The context of transgender health disparities: Social determinants of health and minority stress Disparities in health status, health care access, and health outcomes often arise from conditions that are not explicitly associated with the medical system or the nature of transgender identity but are driven by broader social determinants of health. These determinants include factors such as socioeconomic status, education, and physical environments.^55 Oppressive structures such as racism, sexism, and transphobia influence where transgender people live, how they work, what food they can access, and how they are treated in their environments. For transgender people, social determinants have concrete effects on health. High rates of poverty make medical care unaffordable. High rates of housing instability disrupt the continuity of care. Discrimination by medical providers leads to mistreatment and avoidance of care. Discrimination by employers leads to unemployment and consequent uninsurance. Criminalization and incarceration disrupt the continuity of care and expose transgender people to violence and trauma. Addressing the health disparities faced by transgender people requires addressing the many structural forms of exclusion, discrimination, and violence they endure. Additionally, it is impossible to ignore the health effects of minority stress. The persistent experience of living in an unsafe, degrading environment where one must change behaviors and hide oneâ€™s identity to avoid stigma and discrimination^56 is itself a public health problem that generates unique and pronounced disparities between transgender people and others. In context, then, transgender health is a multifaceted social, economic, and political issue. Furthermore, many transgender people are people of color, people with disabilities, sex workers, or immigrants; their experiences of stigma, discrimination, and socially determined health conditions are distinctive and intersectional. Efforts to address transgender health disparities therefore run the risk of leaving many behind if they do not center the effects of racism, misogyny, criminalization, ableism, and xenophobia on transgender peopleâ€™s health. Social determinants of health and adverse health outcomes Family rejection High rates of rejection from family members are a major contributor to poor health outcomes among transgender people. According to TransPop data, 44 percent of transgender individuals had a parent physically hurt them at least once during childhood,^57 compared with 25 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. Many transgender people report having a more strained or conflicted relationship with their parents than their cisgender heterosexual counterparts (57 percent^58 compared with 22 percent), and many more report being bullied as a minor (46 percent^59 compared with 17 percent). According to the U.S. Transgender Survey, 8 percent of transgender individuals report being kicked out of their home for being transgender, and 10 percent report running away from home.^60 This contributes to the fact that 30 percent of transgender individuals have experienced homelessness at some point in their lifetimeâ€”a number that increases to 51 percent among Black transgender women.^61 Family rejection is also associated with both the misuse of drugs and alcohol and attempted suicide.^62 Barriers to economic security Broadly, transgender individuals encounter systemic and institutional discrimination and barriers to economic security. According to TransPop data, 62 percent of respondents report a personal income of below $25,000 annually, compared with 40 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. More than 1 in 4 transgender respondents from CAPâ€™s 2020 survey reported a household income of less than $25,000 annually.^63 (see Figure 8) Staggeringly, a survey of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals in the southeastern United States found that 79 percent were food insecure.^64 Disparities in economic security and access to food have been proven to affect health status; one survey of transgender individuals in New York state found that those with incomes below the poverty line were almost twice as likely to report fair or poor health.^65 These obstacles not only exacerbate stress, leading to mental and physical ailments, but also make it more difficult for transgender individuals to afford quality care. More than half of transgender individuals reported postponing or not receiving necessary medical care in the year prior to CAPâ€™s survey because they could not afford it, including 60 percent of transgender respondents of color. And 40 percent avoided preventive screenings in the year prior to CAPâ€™s survey due to cost, including 31 percent of transgender respondents of color.^66 Figure 8 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MKnkC The reliance of the U.S. health insurance system on employer-provided coverage creates barriers to care for populations that are vulnerable to unemployment and employment discrimination.^67 In a 2020 CAP survey, 27 percent of transgender respondents reported that they were currently unemployed.^68 More than half of transgender individuals reported that discrimination moderately or significantly affected their capacity to be hired in the year prior to CAPâ€™s survey, while nearly half reported that discrimination had a moderate or significant effect on their ability to retain employment in the year prior to the surveyâ€”with rates of reported discrimination significantly increasing for transgender people of color.^69 (see Figure 9) This discrimination leads to labor market exclusion and lower rates of insurance through employers, with transgender individuals reporting receiving employer-based insurance at a rate 7 percentage points lower than cisgender LGBTQI+ individuals.^70 Overall, transgender adults report uninsurance rates that are 7 percentage points higher than those of cisgender individuals.^71 Figure 9 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1Z9Q5 Housing insecurity and experiences of homelessness Barriers to economic opportunities, labor and housing market discrimination and exclusion, lack of legal protections, and family rejection are main contributors to transgender people experiencing disproportionately high rates of homelessness. Nearly one-third of transgender individuals report living in povertyâ€”compared with just 12 percent of the U.S. population^72â€”limiting their capacity to afford rent or mortgage payments. A majority of states lack legal protections in housing based on gender identity,^73 and 23 percent of transgender individualsâ€”including 49 percent of Black transgender individualsâ€”have reported experiencing some form of housing discrimination, including eviction and the denial of a home or apartment.^74 (see Figure 10) For example, CAP survey data show that 52 percent of transgender individuals reported that discrimination negatively affected their ability to rent or buy a home to some degree in the year prior to the survey, compared with 36 percent of cisgender LGBQI+ respondents. On a basic level, housing is essential to physical and mental health. Safe and stable housing means access to clean water, significantly reduced likelihood of contracting diseases and physical ailments, the proper storage of medications, improved mental health, and reduced health care costs.^75 Figure 10 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Myyxr High rates of homelessness have detrimental effects on mental and physical health and are associated with high rates of drug use, depression, anxiety, and suicide.^76 These effects are worsened due to the lack of safe shelter access. Among transgender individuals who have stayed in shelters, 70 percent have reported experiencing harassment, physical assault, or removal.^77 (see Figure 11) One in 4 transgender individuals experiencing homelessness report avoiding homeless shelters for fear of harassment, and an additional 6 percent have been denied access to shelter,^78 contributing to 63 percent of transgender people experiencing homelessness also being unsheltered.^79 Among unsheltered transgender populations, 60 percent are trimorbid, facing co-occurring physical, mental, and substance use disorders.^80 Unsheltered transgender people are more than seven times as likely to have police interactions and more than eight times as likely to be sent to jail or prison than transgender individuals who are sheltered. Those numbers increase among Black unsheltered transgender individuals.^81 Figure 11 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/q87nJ Interactions with the criminal legal system Transgender individuals are much more likely than their cisgender counterparts both to have negative encounters with law enforcement and to face mental and physical health concerns due to incarceration. Data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey show that of respondents who had a police encounter in the year prior, 58 percent experienced some form of mistreatment, including 61 percent of Black respondents and 71 percent of Latino/a respondents.^82 Police often target transgender people in discretionary interactions. One study of Latina transgender women in Los Angeles found that 60 percent of those who had been stopped by the police had not violated any laws.^83 Most prominently, police often use the pretext that transgender individualsâ€”particularly transgender women, and especially transgender women of colorâ€”are sex workers to create grounds to accost or detain them.^84 This practice is made easier by state statutes criminalizing loitering and practices allowing the possession of condoms to be used as justification for arrest and evidence of prostitution. These policies are so often used to target transgender people that they are referred to as â€œwalking while transâ€ laws.^85 Staggeringly, 22 percent of individuals from the U.S. Transgender Survey who were arrested believe that they were arrested as a result of their gender identity,^86 likely contributing to CAP survey data showing that 50 percent of transgender individuals report avoiding police to avoid experiencing discrimination, compared with 29 percent of cisgender LGBQI+ respondents. Higher rates of contact with the criminal legal system mean that transgender individuals are incarcerated at a rate two times that of cisgender individuals.^87 These rates are even higher among transgender people of color; for example, Black transgender women are incarcerated at a rate 10 times that of the cisgender population. Incarcerated transgender people are often placed in housing in accordance with their gender assigned at birth; are nearly 10 times as likely to be assaulted than the general prison population; and face constant harassment from staff and other incarcerated persons.^88 Many are also disallowed from continuing necessary transition care. One in 3 incarcerated transgender people who had been taking hormones prior to their incarceration were prohibited from taking them.^89 Detention settings Immigrants in detention centers face similar difficulties. Transgender individuals being held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in 2017 were detained more than twice as long as the general population.^90 One in 8 reported being held in solitary confinement,^91 and many have reported experiences of physical abuse and denial of gender-appropriate clothing.^92 Twelve percent of LGBT individuals overall report experiencing sexual abuse and assault, making them 97 times as likely to be sexually victimized than non-LGBT people in custody.^93 There are many reports of transgender individuals being denied access to basic health care, including hormone therapy and necessary care for those living with HIV.^94 Inaccurate identity documents Barriers to obtaining accurate identity documents present additional challenges. State-level restrictions on gender marker and legal name changes vary,^95 with many states requiring approval by a medical provider or court order. These restrictions make identification changes dependent on health care access and therefore inaccessible to many, especially when specific medical procedures are required. Even more barriers to identification changes exist for transgender people with criminal records, who already face unique risks associated with discrimination and law enforcement interactions.^96 CAPâ€™s survey shows that 66 percent of transgender respondents reported discrimination having an impact on their ability to obtain accurate identification documents in the year prior to the survey, compared with 23 percent of cisgender LGB respondents. TransPop data show that 1 in 2 transgender respondents have no identification with their authentic name, and just 1 in 3 have any identification with their authentic pronouns. In practice, this may expose transgender people to harassment, violence, and administrative barriers when engaging with health care providers, the legal system, law enforcement, stores, and banks. Among those whose identifications do not reflect their current name or gender, 25 percent of transgender people have been verbally harassed and 16 percent have been denied services or benefits.^97 Incongruence between identification documents and gender identity has also been associated with worsened mental health, including higher levels of anxiety, depression, and adverse responses to gender-based mistreatment.^98 The context of barriers to care for transgender people: Medical system hostility Hospitals, clinics, and doctorsâ€™ offices should be safe environments where people are given the medical care they need. For many transgender people, this is not the case. Even when providers do not outright refuse to treat transgender people, they may verbally abuse or physically harm their transgender patients.^99 Refusal and abuse of transgender people of color is even more common.^100 For transgender people who use drugs, have disabilities, or experience mental illness, medical system involvement also carries the risk of institutionalization or contact with the criminal legal system. Medical systems can be hostile and discriminatory due to racism and sexism as well,^101 and this hostility is often inseparable from transphobia. Medical system hostility has led to a long-standing reliance by transgender communities on black markets and informal networks to obtain gender-affirming careâ€”practices that have resurfaced as the COVID-19 pandemic erects new barriers. For many, the risks of unregulated substance distribution and potential legal consequences feel safer than having to engage with health care providers.^102 Supporting transgender people through the medical system can only be achieved with the trust of transgender patients. This trust has been violated repeatedly, violently, and fatallyâ€”from the long-standing classification of transgender identity as a mental disorder^103 to the psychologically abusive use of pseudoscientific conversion therapy^104 to the historical and continued failure of public health responses to the HIV epidemic.^105 Medical systems must earn transgender peopleâ€™s trust if they hope to effectively address health disparities. Figure 12 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ccden Receiving adequate care Transgender individuals face additional barriers due to a lack of cultural competency in how to provide treatment for transgender and gender-diverse populations. One in 3 transgender people reported having to teach their doctor about transgender people in order to receive appropriate care in the year prior to CAPâ€™s survey.^106 And 15 percent report being asked â€œinvasive or unnecessary questions about being transgenderâ€ not related to their reason for visiting.^107 Sixty-two percent of transgender respondents from the TransPop survey reported worrying about being judged because of their sexual orientation or gender identity when seeking health care,^108 with 63 percent agreeing that they worry evaluations of them will be negatively affected by these factors. (see Figure 12) More than half of medical school curricula lack information about the unique health issues and treatment of LGBT people beyond work related to HIV, likely contributing to transgender peopleâ€™s inability to access affirming care.^109 Notably, just 20 percent of transgender respondents to TransPop report being very satisfied with the health care they receive, compared with 45 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. And 20 percent of transgender respondents report having no place to go when sick or need advice about health,^110 compared with 10 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. Discrimination also affects the ability to access services, as TransPop data show that 61 percent of transgender respondents report having a personal doctor or health care provider,^111 compared with 76 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. Transgender individuals are less likely to have access to reproductive health services,^112 and 37 percent have to travel more than 10 miles in order to receive routine health care.^113 Figure 13 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fknWn Further damaging are the high rates at which health care providers mistreat and abuse transgender adults. Nearly 1 in 2 transgender individuals, including 68 percent of transgender people of color, reported experiencing mistreatment at the hands of a provider in the year prior to CAPâ€™s survey, including care refusal as well as verbal or physical abuse.^114 (see Figure 13) Twenty-eight percent of transgender individuals reported postponing or not receiving necessary medical care in the year prior to CAPâ€™s survey for fear of experiencing discrimination, including 22 percent of transgender people of color. (see Figure 14) Stigma and discrimination from health care providers has also been explicitly linked to increased levels of substance use among transgender individuals.^115 Figure 14 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aEzMl aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Twitter ""]â€œ[My doctors] treat me as if I had no rights.

Forty-six percent of transgender individuals had a health insurer deny them gender-affirming care in the year prior to CAPâ€™s survey.^116 Fifty-five percent of transgender individuals report needing to travel at least 10 miles in order to receive transition-related care,^117 which can make it inaccessible for many. Notably, while 78 percent of respondents to the U.S. Transgender Survey reported wanting hormone therapy at some point in their life, only 49 percent of respondents have ever received it, and just 25 percent of respondents have had some form of transition-related surgery.^118 (see Figure 15) Figure 15 IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ShgSW Current landscape of legal and regulatory nondiscrimination protections in health care The landscape of legal protections in health care that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) has evolved drastically in recent years. The sections below highlight notable legal and regulatory developments and recommendations for further action under the Biden administration. These recommendations are essential to building a more transgender-inclusive legal apparatus but should also be paired with in-practice policies set out below that promote affirming, quality care. The Bostock decision and President Joe Bidenâ€™s executive order On June 15, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed in Bostock v. Clayton County^119 that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964â€™s prohibition on sex discrimination in employment encompasses discrimination based on SOGI. Prior to the high courtâ€™s landmark decision, courts across the country were already interpreting sex discrimination to also prohibit SOGI discrimination, not just in Title VII but also in other statutes that prohibit sex discrimination,^120 such as Title IX, Section 1557 of the ACA, and the Fair Housing Act.^121 On day one of his presidency, President Biden signed a groundbreaking executive order^122 (EO) directing all agencies to enforce federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination to also prohibit discrimination based on SOGI in areas including but not limited to employment, housing, health care, education, and credit. The EO implements the Bostock decision throughout the countryâ€™s major civil rights laws to consistently protect LGBTQ people from discrimination^123 and ensure equal protection under the law. Recommendations aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Federal agencies should fully implement EO 13988 across the government. Implementation of the EO on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation^124 throughout the government, including in the realms of health care, health insurance, and provision of services is essential. Doing so not only accurately reflects the current state of the law but is also supported by the large^125 majority^126 of Americans who oppose discrimination against transgender people. EO 13988 granted each agency head 100 days to develop plans in consultation with the U.S. attorney general to carry out actions to revise, suspend, rescind previous agency actions or to promulgate new agency actions as necessary to fully implement statutes that prohibit sex discrimination to also prohibit discrimination based on SOGI. As explained below, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has started announcing actions to better enforce SOGI nondiscrimination protections. However, it has not yet released its plan and should do so as soon as possible. Fully implementing these nondiscrimination protections throughout the countryâ€™s health care system is vital, especially given the current wave of discriminatory, dangerous, and harmful state bills that aim to strip transgender people of their rights and ability to access to health care. As highlighted in the previous section, discrimination affects transgender communities across multiple, intersecting areas of life, including health care, employment, and housing. It is therefore imperative that all federal agencies release their plans detailing how they will use their authority to implement SOGI nondiscrimination practices. Congressâ€™ passage of the Equality Act will also be imperative to combating discrimination in multiple key areas of life that jeopardize the ability of transgender people to access health care and maintain economic security. And it would provide legal recourse from discrimination in public spaces and services as well as federally funded programs.^127 aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Reverse the Trump administrationâ€™s overly broad religious exemptions. In implementing this historic EO, the Biden administration should also act across agencies to reverse the Trump administrationâ€™s expansion of overly broad religious exemptions in health care with the aim of instituting a transparent and effective process for determining religious exemptions and third-party burdens. Doing so is particularly important given the increased rate of consolidation among hospitals to those affiliated with Catholic systems and the fact that more than 1 in 6 hospital beds are in Catholic hospitals, many of which follow transgender-exclusive ethical and religious directives from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.^128 aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Twitter ""]â€œWhen Tyler decided to pursue gender-affirming surgery, St. Josephâ€™s Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital near Tylerâ€™s home and community was the natural hospital choice.

She felt humiliated and dehumanized.â€" Discrimination in health care settings Section 1557 is the primary nondiscrimination provision of the ACA, which prohibits health programs or facilities that receive federal funding from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex. Notably, Section 1557 incorporates the grounds and enforcement of mechanisms of various civil rights statutes, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972â€™s prohibition on sex discrimination in health care programs and activities, a statute which many courts have consistently found applies to discrimination on the basis of SOGI.^129 Overall, the Section 1557 statute incorporates the grounds of existing federal civil rights laws and prohibits discrimination by federally funded health programs such that an individual cannot be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination on these bases by any health program or activity that receives federal financial assistance.^130 In 2016, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a historic^131 rule codifying nondiscrimination protections for transgender people in health facilities, programs, and activities that receive federal funding. The rule clarified^132 that the sex nondiscrimination protections in Section 1557 explicitly protect transgender individuals on the basis of gender identity and confirmed that individuals must have access to health care facilities and programs that are in accordance with their gender identity. Regrettably, in 2020, the Trump administration promulgated a final rule creating numerous harms by attempting to erase specific nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity and sex stereotyping.^133 Litigation over the final rule is ongoing,^134 but courts have affirmed that gender identity discrimination is prohibited under the statute itself as well as under the 2016 ruleâ€™s protections based on â€œsex stereotyping,â€ and some parts of the 2020 final rule related to LGBT people are currently enjoined.^135 In light of the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in Bostock and subsequent court decisions, on May 10, 2021, the HHS announced that the OCR will interpret and enforce Section 1557 of the ACA and Title IXâ€™s prohibition on discrimination based on sex to include discrimination on the basis of SOGI.^136 The OCR simultaneously issued a notice of this new interpretation and its intent to accept, investigate, and resolve complaints of health care discrimination on the basis of SOGI under Section 1557.^137 Recommendation aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Engage in rule-making to strengthen nondiscrimination protections in Section 1557 and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations. While the interpretation helps to clarify explicit protections for LGBTQ people in federally funded health programs under Section 1557, numerous questions remain. For example, the announcement does not provide additional guidance or examples on what it means for covered entities not to discriminate based on SOGI and behaviors that could trigger review by the OCR; it does not resolve any of the pending litigation over the 2020 rule; it does not restore protection eliminated by the conforming amendments to CMS regulations that were implemented with the 2020 rule; and it remains unclear how the OCR will approach questions surrounding the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,^138 which protects the free exercise of religious belief, and how it interacts with Section 1557, if at all, as well as prior court orders in its enforcement of Section 1557, as stated in the announcement.^139 Future rule-making and litigation should be expected. The administration should engage in notice-and-comment rule-making at the HHS to strengthen Section 1557â€™s nondiscrimination protections by explicitly prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, gender transition, transgender status, sex stereotypes, and sex characteristics (including intersex traits) and clarify the same scope of claims and remedies exist under Section 1557 regardless of the type of discrimination; reverse the CMS conforming amendments and clarify the scope of coverage and nondiscrimination in CMS rules for the Marketplace, Medicaid, and Medicare; and clarify protections for transgender and gender-diverse patients in health care and coverage by adopting regulatory and preamble language, guidance, technical assistance and enforcement efforts that underscore the wide range of scenarios in which discrimination against transgender patients can occur and is prohibited under federal law. Finally, the HHS should publish the 2016 proposed rule^140 establishing explicit nondiscrimination protections on the basis of SOGI within the Medicare and Medicaid conditions of participation for health care organizations. These conditions apply to facilities and providers and should include strong language about inpatient treatment prohibiting discrimination and harassment based on gender identity. The HHSâ€™s OCR should also publish a yearly report with information about complaints and resolutions and disaggregate data by bases of complaints and numbers of investigations and complaints closed.

This is a life and death matter. Without hormone blockers, my sonâ€™s anxiety and anger will be out of control and his mental health will deteriorate.â€" There is a growing consensus among expert and medical organizations that gender-affirming health care, including surgical procedures, is medically necessary.^141 Historically, however, transgender-specific exclusions have been deployed by public and private health insurers to deny transgender people coverage for medically necessary care, including for care unrelated to gender affirmation.^142 For example, insurers would regularly deny transgender people services and procedures such as hormone therapy, mental health counseling, preventive screenings, and surgeries that are regularly covered for cisgender people. The 2016 Section 1557 ruleâ€”and many statesâ€™ changes before that^143â€”prohibited insurers from categorically excluding services related to gender-affirming health care, including gender-affirming surgeries, and from imposing discriminatory restrictions based on gender identity. Notably, numerous court decisions have found that these categorical exclusions violate Section 1557 or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act in employer-provided insurance plans.^144 Prior to the 2020 final rule, the number of private companies that were eliminating exclusions in their employee coverage appeared to be rapidly increasing,^145 and many insurers in the individual market removed transgender-specific exclusions, even after this part of the rule was enjoined in court.^146 However, the Trump administrationâ€™s final rule eliminated these explicit regulatory protections, resulting in a lack of clarity and life-threatening^147 consequences for transgender people across the country. Recommendations aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Clarify that transgender exclusions do not comply with federal law. The HHS should issue guidance to state Medicaid directors stating that transgender-specific exclusions are out of compliance with federal law. This guidance should suggest enforcement mechanisms, enumerate the ways in which medical necessity determinations can be applied in a discriminatory manner, and urge insurers to affirmatively state their plans cover medically necessary care for gender dysphoria.^148 State Medicaid programs should immediately remove any exclusions and promulgate coverage protocols for gender-affirming care that are grounded in the most up-to-date medical standards of care in the field of transgender medicine.^149 aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Encourage state and federal regulatory bodies to adopt similar affirmative coverage language. These measures should include efforts to improve the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversightâ€™s (CCIIO) review process of plans to ensure compliance with state- and federal-level gender identity nondiscrimination requirements.^150 Because transgender consumers continue to find it challenging to obtain information from insurers regarding whether gender-affirming care will be covered,^151 the federal government should also invest additional funding in LGBTQI-specific outreach and enrollment support for transgender consumers in the individual health insurance market and Medicaid. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Improve Medicare coverage. Absent a national coverage determination,^152 coverage decisions fall on the Medicare Administrative Contractors and Medicare Advantage plans,^153 where restrictive and discriminatory policies persist. To help address this issue, the CMS should add a provision to the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual that explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of SOGI when making coverage determinations. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Eliminate exclusions and expand care for federal employees. Operated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers health insurance coverage for which most federal employees are eligible.^154 Unfortunately, program members continue to be denied gender-affirming care and services regarded as medically necessary by the World Professional Association for Transgender Healthâ€™s Standards of Care.^155 Partly or wholly excluding transgender health care from employer insurance plans constitutes discrimination under federal law.^156 In compliance with the recently announced EO on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce and Section 1557, the OPM should take action to remove existing exclusions or other restrictions and direct carriers to cover comprehensive gender-affirming care through the FEHB to transgender employees, including beneficiaries and eligible dependents.^157 Furthermore, in light of its recent announcement,^158 the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should act to remove the existing discriminatory exclusion for gender-affirming surgical care,^159 as well as any other restrictions that limit the ability of transgender veterans to access gender-affirming care.^160 aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Explicitly clarify protections for transgender patients in health care. Any notice-and-comment rule-making related to Section 1557 should clarify protections for transgender and gender-diverse patients in health care and coverage. Through the rule, enforcement mechanisms, and technical assistance to insurers and providers, the HHS should provide clear guidance on what it means for covered entities and providers not to discriminate against transgender patients and the wide range of scenarios in which discrimination can occur. At a minimum, the CMS should issue a letter to state Medicaid directors notifying them of these actions and clarifying protections. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Improve enforcement and accountability through technical assistance and oversight. While studies show that insurers have largely moved away from transgender-specific categorical exclusions in plans, insurers continue to discriminatorily reject coverage.^161 As such, to promote enforcement and accountability among insurers, the above actions should be paired with technical assistance and oversight mechanisms through the CCIIO. To ensure HHS enforcement of these nondiscrimination protections will require a strong Section 1557 rule and an OCR that is adequately funded to meet its caseload and investigate complaints thoroughly. Filing lawsuits against entities violating nondiscrimination protections in health care places labor and a fiscal burden on patients, while proactive civil rights enforcement mechanisms will institute systemic accountability and lessen that burden. The OCR should simultaneously implement awareness campaigns to ensure that transgender people are aware of their right to nondiscrimination and lift up highly valuable community-based legal resources.

The HHSâ€™s central nondiscrimination regulation for federal awards required HHS-funded service providers not to discriminate based on nonmerit factors such as sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, among others.^164 In November 2019, however, the Trump administration released a notice of nonenforcement for key nondiscrimination provisions for many HHS programs,^165 and in January 2021 it finalized a rule^166 that strips beneficiaries of HHS-funded services of these explicit comprehensive nondiscrimination protections and attempts to permit service providers to discriminate based on nonmerit factors including sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.^167 There are lawsuits currently pending against both the notice of nonenforcement and the grants rule.^168 Recommendation aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Immediately rescind the 2019 notice of nonenforcement and restore nondiscrimination protections. In addition to rescinding the notice of nonenforcement issued in 2019, the Biden administration should work to restore protections by engaging in notice-and-comment rule-making to rescind the final grants rule, which has yet to go into effect but is set to go into effect in August 2021.^169 The HHS should also clearly require nondiscrimination as a condition of issuing grants and avoid overly broad religious exemptions that remove crucial safeguards designed to protect people accessing government-funded services at faith-based providers from discrimination. COVID-19 administrative actions Transgender communities have been hit especially hard by the health, economic, and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.^170 In addition to being at greater risk of suffering severe illness from the coronavirus,^171 transgender people reported experiencing disproportionately high rates of serious financial hardship and employment disruption during the pandemic, undermining their economic security, housing stability, and ability to afford and access care. ^172 Recommendations aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Integrate targeted relief for transgender communities into coronavirus testing, vaccine, and recovery efforts. During the first days of his presidency, President Biden signed various EOs to promote a strategic, data-driven, and equity-centered approach to addressing the pandemic.^173 These actions should be used as an opportunity to integrate targeted relief to support transgender communities. For example, federal and state governments should partner with and financially support community-based organizations to issue vaccine distribution plans and outreach campaigns targeting transgender communities; share information about accessing testing, vaccines, and the right to receive services free from discrimination under the law; and dispel misinformation about how vaccines may interfere with transition-related care.^174 The pandemic has also highlighted the need for a national paid sick leave policy. The administration should continue to support efforts to expand paid medical and family leave for transgender people by adopting an inclusive definition of chosen-family caregiving relationships^175â€”a provision included in the presidentâ€™s proposed American Families Plan, which Congress should act to adopt.^176 aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Enhance data collection to shed light on the experiences of transgender people during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are numerous steps that the HHS, with the support of the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, should take to support data collection that will provide greater clarity on the experiences of transgender people during the pandemic.^177 The existing COVID-19 laboratory data guidance from the HHS^178 should be revised to require voluntary data collection and reporting on SOGI in COVID-19 testing, care, and vaccination uptake in a manner that protects privacy and confidentiality for individuals. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case report form^179 should add SOGI questions and alter its sex question response options to be more inclusive. Additionally, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative and Office should add SOGI to its COVID-19 Clinical Data Warehouse Data Dictionary, and the national coordinator of health information technology should require the HL7 electronic health record to add SOGI measures to foster better data exchanges between clinical and reporting systems. Finally, the HHS should ensure the CDCâ€™s Data Modernization Initiative^180 directs funding to and prioritizes expanding and enhancing SOGI data collection in public health surveillance. Taking these steps is essential to collect more accurate information on transgender peoplesâ€™ health needs, bring visibility to their experiences throughout the pandemic, and help federal, state, and local programs reduce disparities and improve access to care during the pandemic and beyond. Data collection Persistent lack of routine data collection on gender identity, as well as sexual orientation and intersex status, remains a significant barrier for researchers, advocates, and policymakers alike.^181 Data collection mechanisms often conflate sex and gender or rely solely on a binary model of sex and gender that fails to capture health outcomes for transgender and other gender-diverse populations.^182 To better understand and address health disparities that transgender communities face, it is imperative that federal agencies, including the HHS, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Labor, expand and enhance data collection efforts to add measures for SOGI and to test and implement intersex status measures. Doing so is crucial to advancing research agendas, evaluating population trends, equitably distributing funding resources, tracking and addressing discrimination, and designing evidence-based policy solutions to promote equity and reduce existing disparities that transgender communities face across key areas of life.^183 Recommendations aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Expand and enhance data collection efforts under the HHS. For example, the CDC should prioritize adding SOGI measures to the standardized demographic core questionnaire of the BRFSS and the National Violent Death Reporting System as well as adding gender identity questions to the National Health Interview Survey. Expansion of data collection should be paired with funding, technical assistance, and training to facilitate implementation and ensure high standards for collection, storage, sharing, and use that promote security and confidentiality. These actions should include efforts to meaningfully engage directly with transgender communities and organizations for the purposes of qualitative and quantitative research. Access to identification documents Gender-incongruent forms of identification expose transgender people to a range of adverse outcomes and pose a significant barrier to accessing a wide range of services, including those related to health care. Unfortunately, many states^184 still impose intrusive and burdensome requirements^185 for transgender people to update their IDsâ€”such as providing proof of surgery or court ordersâ€”to amend driverâ€™s licenses or birth certificates. In June 2021, President Biden signed an EO on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce,^186 directing relevant agencies to take steps to facilitate access to identity credentials that meet the needs of transgender, gender-nonconforming, and nonbinary employees and to reduce unnecessary administrative burden for updating employee identity credentials. Also in June 2021, the U.S. Department of State announced it will be updating procedures for issuance of U.S. passports and consular reports of birth abroad to allow applicants to â€œself-select their gender as â€˜Mâ€™ or â€˜Fâ€™ and will no longer require medical certification if an applicantâ€™s self-selected gender does not match the gender on their other citizenship or identity documents.â€^187 Recommendation aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Facilitate the process through which transgender people acquire accurate IDs. As part of the EO on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government,^188 all relevant federal agencies ensure that wherever federal ID documents or administrative records list gender, individuals can select a designation for M, F, or X, and remove medical certification. Gender-incongruent identification increases the risk of exposing transgender people to discrimination, harassment, violence, and administrative barriers when engaging in a variety of settings. As such, states should also modernize their policies or processes for transgender people to access identificationâ€”such as driverâ€™s licenses, birth certificates, and legal name changesâ€”that matches their gender identity.^189 In-practice policies to promote affirming, inclusive, and culturally competent care Beyond nondiscrimination legal protections Nondiscrimination protections alone cannot rectify the health consequences of the long-standing structural exclusion that transgender people face. Access to legal recourse in instances of discrimination in health care does not address many of the social determinants contributing to inadequate health care, such as persistent poverty, criminalization, and unemployment. Furthermore, many harmful actions by providers may not constitute or be recognized as formal discriminationâ€”even with protections, mistreatment and consequent avoidance will continue. Proactive efforts to promote access to health care, including through targeted support for affirming health care programs and increasing cultural competence among health care providers, are also needed. Needs beyond nondiscrimination protections are visible in locations such as Washington, D.C. Despite the district having some of the most transgender-inclusive health care protections in the country,^190 a DC Trans Coalition survey found that transgender people in Washington, D.C., were much more likely to be uninsured, HIV positive, use illicit substances, or experience suicidality, with transgender people of color reporting higher rates in all these categories.^191 The organizationâ€™s community needs assessment found that access to â€œtrans-sensitive health careâ€ was the communityâ€™s top priority.^192 A further study of sex workers in Washington, D.C., most of whom were transgender, identified sex work criminalization and housing insecurity as the primary barriers to their health and well-being.^193 Trans-sensitive health care is not simply access to medical transition through hormones and surgeries. While medical transition is widely recognized as holistically beneficial to those who seek it out,^194 the pressing health care needs of many transgender people include care for chronic conditions,^195 care associated with disability, and mental health treatment^196â€”and not all transgender people would choose to medically transition even if this care were available. Meanwhile, many health providers lack basic knowledge of the health experiences of transgender people and must increase their cultural competence to effectively serve their transgender patients. According to CAPâ€™s nationally representative survey, in the year prior, 33 percent of transgender respondents reported having to teach their doctor or provider about transgender people in order to receive appropriate care; 32 percent of respondents reported misgendering by doctors or providers; and 38 percent reported providers being visibly uncomfortable due to actual or perceived gender identity. Transgender people of color faced even higher rates of mistreatment in all these categories.^197 aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Twitter ""]â€œI broke my foot and I went to physical therapy and they wouldnâ€™t respect my pronouns at all [...] They would change me a lot [to new/different physical therapists].

Walking hurts.â€" Resources for training insurers, providers, and administrative staff in cultural competence are already available.^198 Adding funding and guidance from federal and state governments would aid in ensuring their widespread implementation, as would increased emphasis on cultural competence in the standard education of health care providers. Evidence demonstrates the multifaceted harms of unsupportive, stigmatizing, and discriminatory care and highlights the benefits of culturally competent, inclusive, and gender-affirming care.^199 The below sections offer recommendations for in-practice policies and procedures that should be adopted by health providers.^200 Notably, these policies are interconnected and should be implemented together to foster a holistically inclusive and supporting health care environment for transgender and gender-nonconforming patients. Increase funding for programs that advance the health of transgender communities The data and findings presented throughout this report highlight the significant and intersectional impacts that discrimination, minority stress, violence, and various social determinants of health have on the physical, mental, and behavioral health of transgender adults. In addition to the nondiscrimination regulatory and in-practice policies recommended here, there are multiple broad-based policies and investments beyond the scope of this report that will also help to address the myriad harms, barriers to care, and disparities that transgender communities face. For example,^201 the Biden administration, Congress, and state and local governments should increase funding and support for entities providing LGBTQI+ family acceptance models; integrated and culturally competent mental and behavioral health services that take a trauma-informed, harm-reduction approach; LGBTQI+ community health centers; affordable housing models that are explicitly designed for transgender communities; efforts to combat violence and improve attitudes toward transgender people;^202 collaborative, restorative justice, and community-centered organizations providing LGBTQI+ survivors of violence with support services; and LGBTQI+ and HIV-targeted reentry services.^203 Furthermore, the administration should continue to incentivize Medicaid expansion in states that have failed to do so; encourage states to expand reimbursement and utilization of telemedicine services through Medicaid and the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program; and work with Congress to permanently expand the American Rescue Plan Actâ€™s provision of lower health insurance premiums for people purchasing coverage on the ACA exchanges, as recently proposed in the American Families Plan. Improving access to these kinds of crucial programs and services is a cross-cutting endeavor that requires strategic coordination among different federal and state actors. Adopt LGBTQI-inclusive administrative data systems Many health care-related forms fail to include informational options that reflect the diversity of sexual and gender identities, and family types. Health care providers should review their current documentation policies and protocols, as well as intake forms, to ensure inclusive^204 language^205 and form options related to SOGI and intersex demographic questions, authentic names and pronouns, relationship status and definitions of family, as well as questions related to sexual history, family planning, and gynecological history. Adopting these kinds of inclusive forms must also be paired with administrative procedures and training to ensure patients are not misgendered or subject to other kinds of violence and abuse. Health care institutions should also adopt existing best practices for collecting gender identity data in electronic health records.^206 Foster affirming environments in health care settings Given the widespread discrimination and negative experiences that transgender people encounter in health settings, as well as the historic pathologizing of transgender people by the medical community, it is crucial for health care providers to communicate to transgender patients that they are entering an inclusive and affirming environment where they will be treated with respect. In addition to staff training, it is important that the physical space and materials available to patients are inclusive of LGBTQI+ people. At minimum, for example, the terms â€œsexual orientation,â€ â€œgender identity,â€ â€œgender expression,â€ and â€œsex characteristicsâ€ should be added to providersâ€™ nondiscrimination policyâ€”and placed in areas of high visibilityâ€”as well as added to patient handouts and providersâ€™ websites.^207 Additionally, materials specific to the needs of transgender patients related to general care and gender-affirming care should be available and visible. Where possible, patient navigation services for transgender patients seeking gender-affirming care should be provided. Provide regular staff training on cultural competency and readiness It is imperative that both administrative staff and clinical providers receive annual cultural competency training related to transgender and gender-diverse identities and terminology, as well as how to avoid stereotyping or making assumptions about a patientâ€™s gender identity.^208 Mandatory training^209 for front-line staff should also include materials on best practices related to addressing patients, using names and pronouns, obtaining information related to insurance or medical records, and generally creating an affirming environment for transgender and nonbinary patients.^210 To ensure implementation, the government should include high-quality LGBTQI+ cultural competency as a mandatory component in all federally conducted or supported training programs for grantees, including federally employed health care providers such as those at the VA. The CMS could also encourage cultural competency by reinstating the former policy of requiring that managed care plans include information in the provider directory on whether the Medicare and Medicaid participating providers have completed cultural competency training, which should include LGBTQI+ cultural competency training.^211 The Health Resources and Services Administration should receive additional funding to support the dissemination and implementation of trainings for health center staff, and LGBTQI+ cultural competency training could be incorporated as a prerequisite for certification as a community health center.^212 Adopt clinical standards and education on the health experiences and needs of transgender communities Presently, among many clinical providers there exists a lack of knowledge and cultural competence concerning the experiences and health care needs of transgender people; a lack of mental and behavioral health specialist services; and a lack of awareness regarding health professionalsâ€™ own biases resulting in unequal and discriminatory treatment that deter people from seeking care and ultimately exacerbate disparities.^213 In addition to cultural competency training, clinical providers should receive robust medical training and learn education curricula about the health care risks and needs of transgender populations located within a deeper understanding of the social, political, and economic forces that shape existing disparities and challenges. It is imperative that providers adopt the most recent standards of clinical care from expert bodies, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, and that medical education institutions explicitly adopt these materials into their curricula through bodies such as the Association of American Medical Colleges. For example, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration should develop and disseminate cultural competency curricula on LGBTQI+ patients in federally funded medical facilities, medical training programs, and providers participating in Medicaid. Moreover, the government should incentivize training and education related to these clinical standards of care in federally conducted or supported training programs for grantees, including federally employed health care providers such as those at the VA. States could also work to adopt National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care, which should be continuously modified to be inclusive of and better aligned with meeting the needs of transgender and gender-diverse patients.^214 Increase funding for community health centers and other safety net providers The historical and continued hostility of insurers and providers has led many transgender people to rely on community health centers, which were often created by LGBTQI+ communities themselves. While these services remain uncommon outside of urban areas and coastal states, they provide urgently needed and affordable care targeted to LGBTQI+ populations.^215 In these areas, support for existing, trusted services is essential to transgender health. Federal funding for community health centers can be increased through the Health Resources and Services Administration designating LGBTQ people as a Medically Underserved Population and a Health Professional Shortage Area population.^216 Existing health disparities and a shortage of culturally competent providers clearly justify these designations, which would increase community health centersâ€™ access to funding streams.^217 The HHS has proposed regulations to restore access to Title X funding to many providers and ensure equity for underserved populations in the provision of Title X funds.^218 Programs qualify for Title X funds due to their provision of family planning services, and Title X programs have historically been crucial for transgender people due to their low-barrier provision of STI treatment and prevention services, basic health maintenance, and gender-affirming care.^219 In 2018, for example, 100 Planned Parenthood affiliates provided hormone therapy for transgender people,^220 and many Title X providers offer comprehensive and targeted care for LGBTQ populations.^221 The Trump-era domestic gag rule^222 imposed onerous requirements on Title X grantees offering abortion-related care or referrals, decimating funding for this essential network of providers.^223 In addition to rescinding the domestic gag rule, the HHSâ€™s efforts to repair Title X should create a pathway for reentry to evidence-based Title X grantees excluded due to the gag rule, including reissuing the funding opportunity announcement and ensuring protections from adverse action by state governments against Title X programs. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Twitter ""]â€œI have argued with pharmacists who refuse to dispense my testosterone because the way I use it is â€˜off label use.â€™ I have been asked invasive questions about my body including details about my genitals, surgical history, and sexual history that were irrelevant to the circumstances which led me to seek medical care."" Develop policies to prevent violence against transgender people The Biden administration has created an Interagency Working Group on Safety, Inclusion, and Opportunity for Transgender Americans, which is intended in part to address violence against transgender people and the factors contributing to it.^224 The establishment of this group presents a unique opportunity to coordinate federal policymaking to proactively address poverty, housing insecurity, criminalization, and resulting outcomes in victimization. Such policies must be developed with reliance on the input and expertise of affected people and advocates. In 2019, only 13.9 percent of law enforcement agencies submitted data on hate crimes to the FBI.^225 This drastic underreporting prevents research into the scale and nature of gender identity-based violence and hampers the development of evidence-based policies to combat it. The administration should develop accountability measures for noncompliance with hate crime reporting standards, including audits and conditioning of federal grants to law enforcement agencies. It should also work to establish processes for hate violence reporting outside of law enforcement channels, such as through hotlines and local 211 lines that may be more trusted by communities vulnerable to negative law enforcement interactions. Intimate partner violence presents a complex problem for transgender peopleâ€”and one which law enforcement agencies are not equipped to address. Economic insecurity can exacerbate intimate partner violence, creating special vulnerabilities to financial abuse.^226 Comprehensive efforts to improve the economic security of transgender people would begin to address these factors. Expanded funding for affirming services for survivors of violence and implementation of nondiscrimination protections in emergency services such as shelters would mitigate the immediate effects of these issues by increasing transgender survivorsâ€™ access to support systems. Addressing violence against transgender sex workers is complicated by the effects of sex work criminalization on survivorsâ€™ access to support systems and health care.^227 Improved economic security and funding for affirming services must be complemented by efforts to advance the decriminalization of sex work. Policies to prevent violence against transgender people must also address the direct role of law enforcement and carceral systems in perpetrating this violence. Transgender people are seven times more likely than cisgender people to experience physical violence when interacting with the police^228 and five times more likely than the general population to be sexually assaulted by facility staff in jails, prisons, and juvenile detention.^229 These dangers must be addressed through broader efforts to decrease law enforcement interactions and criminal legal system involvement among transgender people, including policies advancing the decriminalization of sex work, rather than increased funding for law enforcement training. Efforts to address the HIV epidemic and support people living with HIV CDC data reveal that transgender communities, particularly Black/African American transgender people, Hispanic/Latino transgender people, and transgender women in general, are disproportionately affected by HIV. In 2018, 2 percent of all new HIV diagnoses in the United States and dependent areas were among transgender people, with disproportionate new HIV diagnoses among Black/African American transgender women and Black/African American transgender men, as well as among transgender people aged 25 to 34.^230 HIV prevalence is roughly 20 times higher among transgender people, and roughly 30 times higher among transgender women, than among the general population.^231 To address existing disparities and continue working toward the HHSâ€™s goal of ending HIV by 2030^232 requires that biomedical prevention and treatment options for HIV only be adopted as part of a more holistic approach that recognizes the structural and systemic barriers that lead to disproportionate effects among transgender communities of color. These barriers include the criminalization of sex work, drug use, and HIV status, which prevent many transgender people from safely engaging with public health initiatives.^233 The administration must adopt an approach that meaningfully involves and centers the experiences of people living with HIV and the policy recommendations generated by and for communities marginalized by HIV.^234 As part of the CDCâ€™s efforts to realize the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plan,^235 the authors recommend the following actions. Increase funding for a range of HIV-related programs and initiatives For example, budgetary funding increases for all domestic HIV and viral hepatitis programsâ€”including Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS, the CDCâ€™s Division of Viral Hepatitis, and the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Programâ€”to provide services and supports for low-income people with HIV are critical to getting the nation on track to end HIV by 2030. The HHS should also work with HIV leaders to modernize the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and continue to increase access to essential services for program recipients, thereby reducing barriers to access. More broadly, the HHS should fund and scale programs providing biomedical prevention and treatment options for HIV such as HIV testing, preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis (PrEP and PEP), treatment-as-prevention strategies, and long-acting HIV treatment options. These actions must be complemented by investments to fund and bring to scale innovative messaging and stigma reduction strategies for priority HIV populations advanced by the communities of people living with HIV, such as Undetectable Equals Untransmittable. Continue to support strategies for prevention, treatment, and harm reduction Strategies to prevent new HIV transmissions should include adequately funded collaboration with municipalities and nongovernmental organizations able to engage sex workers and people who use drugs^236 as well as the adoption of evidence-based harm reduction strategies, including syringe service programs, medication-assisted treatment, and the institution of overdose prevention sites. Syringe exchanges reduce the risk of transmission among at-risk populations^237 and must be supported, including through a congressional allocation of appropriations funds through opioid epidemic initiatives and the removal of restrictions on syringe purchases by these programs. This would reduce the harms associated with hormone injection, substance use, HIV, and hepatitis C among transgender people who cannot easily access safe supplies.^238 Revise U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) positions criminalizing overdose prevention sites The DOJ has prevented the development of overdose prevention sites through an interpretation of 21 USC 856, the so-called â€œcrack house statuteâ€ of the Controlled Substance Act.^239 Decades of research have consistently shown the health and safety benefits of overdose prevention sites, which provide supervision and safer environments and supplies for injection drug use.^240 The DOJ must drop pending cases challenging overdose prevention sites and institute policies deprioritizing future prosecution of sites under the Controlled Substances Act. Adopt HIV surveillance and research safeguards A key pillar of the EHE, the molecular HIV surveillance (MHS) collects and tracks peopleâ€™s biological data with the aim of allowing public health systems to trace networks of HIV transmission and identify transmission clusters to offer prevention and health care services.^241 Unfortunately, these surveillance systems utilize and share data without the consent of people living with HIV and lack meaningful accountability mechanisms, exacerbating mistrust among people living with HIV and concerns about whether data will be used to criminalize these communities.^242 More than 30 states have laws criminalizing HIV transmission, exposure, or nondisclosure that state legislatures should repeal.^243 The CDC should issue a moratorium on MHS until adequate safeguards are created and implemented to protect the privacy and autonomy of people living with HIV, bolster community trust, and eliminate opportunities for criminalization and other unintended consequences. Implementation of surveillance systems must be responsive to the input of networks of people living with HIV. Conclusion Discrimination, stigma, poverty, and violence significantly affect the physical, mental, and behavioral health of transgender adults and drive disparities in access to health insurance and adequate care. To improve these outcomes and the experiences of transgender patients in health care settings, it is critical to adopt both robust nondiscrimination laws and in-practice policies that are affirming, inclusive, and culturally competent throughout all areas of the U.S. health care system. Given the current slate of discriminatory and harmful state-level bills that seek to strip transgender youth and adults of their rights and access to health care, fully implementing these protections is vital and will have life-saving consequences. The current administrationâ€™s executive actions to combat discrimination on the basis of SOGI^244 and to advance support for underserved communities^245 offer opportunities to facilitate these changes. The time for the federal agencies and health providers to act is now.

Appendix A This report draws from original CAP analyses of three data sources, outlined below. 1. CAPâ€™s nationally representative survey of LGBTQI+ Americans, conducted in June 2020 This sample includes data from 1,528 LGBTQI+-identifying individuals, including 121 transgender individuals, collected with assistance from NORC at the University of Chicago using their AmeriSpeak panel. A sample of U.S. adults ages 18 and older who self-identified as LGBTQI+ was selected for this study, and this sample has been weighted to account for both U.S. population characteristics and survey nonresponse. The full results of the study, along with a detailed overview of the methodology, are on file with the authors. For additional information on survey results, please see CAPâ€™s related report^246 and interactive.^247 All statistics from CAPâ€™s survey comparing transgender respondents with cisgender LGBTQI+ respondents are significant at the 0.05 level. 2. The 2019 edition of the CDCâ€™s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System This survey is a collaborative project between the CDC, U.S. states, and participating territories. It is conducted by phone among U.S. adults ages 18 years and older and asks a series of questions regarding health-related risk behaviors, diseases, and chronic conditions. The survey is comprised of a core set of questions as well as additional modules that states have the option of including. Currently, 31 states and one territory have opted to include questions to ascertain an individualâ€™s gender identity, creating a sample of 232,088 cisgender individuals and 955 transgender individuals. This data is weighted to account for probability of selection, nonresponse bias, and U.S. population characteristics. All statistics comparing transgender respondents with cisgender respondents are significant at the 0.05 level. Data and a detailed methodology are on file with the authors and available publicly via the CDC.^248 3. The TransPop study, conducted by the Williams Institute, Columbia University, Harvard University, and the Fenway Institute at Fenway Health TransPop is the first nationally representative survey of transgender individuals in the United States. Conducted over the phone and mail by Gallup from 2016 to 2018, the TransPop study was a national probability sample of 1,436 adults over the age of 18, including 274 transgender individuals and 1,040 cisgender heterosexual individuals. The sample has been weighted to account for both survey nonresponse and U.S. population characteristics. For a full overview of the methodology behind TransPop, please see the Methodology section of the Williams Instituteâ€™s overview report on TransPop.^249 The Williams Institute released a comprehensive overview of results from its TransPop and Generations surveys in June 2021.^250 This overview included the vast majority of statistics for transgender respondents to TransPop cited in this report. Where a statistic cited here was taken from this overview, an endnote is included to account for it. In addition, Feldman and others recently released a study comparing health and health care access of transgender and cisgender individuals, also cited in this report and an important resource for providing a thorough overview of differences in health outcomes.^251 Where TransPop statistics have no corresponding endnote, as is the case with statistics for cisgender heterosexual respondents to TransPop, the statistic comes from original CAP data analysis. All comparisons between transgender and cisgender heterosexual individuals from TransPop are significant at the 0.1 level.

The survey results reveal LGBTQI+ communitiesâ€™ experiences in a wide range of situations in both the public and private spheresâ€”including discrimination, physical and mental well-being, medical care, the workforce, education, and government services. It also breaks down participantsâ€™ responses along demographic lines such as race and ethnicity, gender identity, age, disability status, and educational attainment. Survey results play a critical role in better understanding these groupsâ€™ realities and informing policy responses to disparities as well as paths forward for potential future research.

A person designated male at birth who identifies as female is a transgender woman, while a person designated female at birth who identifies as male is a transgender man. In recent years, transgender has become an umbrella term that includes not only people who are binary (male or female) but also those who are non-binary or gender-non-conforming. Gender affirmation, or the process of aligning one's outward expression of gender with one's inward sense of gender, is central to the transgender identity. Medical treatments or surgery may be involved, but not always. This article explains what it means to be transgender, including the terminology used and how to use it correctly. It also describes the process of gender affirmation and some of the serious challenges faced by transgender people today.

Equality and self-affirmarmation. Oleg Lyfar / Getty Images What It Means to Be Transgender Transgender traditionally means to identify as male if you were assigned female at birth or to identify as female if you were assigned male at birth. And, to many, that remains the definition of "transgender," described on the male-female binary. But not everyone sees gender in the same way. Those who are non-binary view gender on a spectrum where roles and expectations aren't automatically assigned based on what genitals a person is born with. As such, a non-binary person may identify as male and female, as neither male nor female, or as their own unique gender (described by some as the "third gender"). In the current vernacular, non-binary people may fall under the "transgender umbrella" when they consciously move away from expected gender roles and align themselves, their presentation, and sometimes their bodies with their own gender identity. In the end, gender identity is one's internal sense of gender even if that means no gender at all. Examples include: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Agender: Identifying with no gender aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Bigender: Identifying with both male and female gender characteristics aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Cisgender: Identifying with the sex you were assigned at birth aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Genderfluid or genderqueer: Shifting between genders or outside of society's expectations of gender aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Pangender or polygender: Displaying or experiencing parts of all genders aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Third Spirit: An umbrella term that describes different sexualities and genders in Indigenous Native American people Gender Identity vs. Sexual Orientation Gender and sex are not the same thing, and neither are gender identity and sexual orientation. Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender, which can correspond to a person's assigned sex or differ from it. Sexual orientation is a person's identity in relation to the gender or genders they are sexually attracted to. Gender Affirmation and Gender Expression Whether binary or non-binary, the one characteristic that connects all transgender people is that the gender assigned to them at birth does not match their own internal sense of gender identity. This mismatch can be felt from as early as three to five years in some transgender children. Others may not recognize it until puberty when changes in their bodies create a palpable sense of unease about their gender and all that implies. Others still may not recognize this until later in life. This uneasiness is referred to as gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is not a psychological illness. It simply describes distress caused by the misalignment of a person's assigned gender and gender identity. In response to gender dysphoria, a transgender person may pursue gender affirmation in its different forms to align their gender identity (their inward sense of gender) with their gender expression (their outward expression of their gender). Gender affirmation (formerly known as gender transitioning) can include one or all of the following: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Social affirmation, which may involve changing your name and pronouns, your manner (such as the way you sit and talk), your appearance (such as your clothing and hair), and the washroom you use aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Legal affirmation, which may involve changing your name and gender on your driver's license, birth certificate, bank accounts, passport, medical records, and other governmental and non-governmental records aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Medical affirmation, which may involve gender-affirming hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries (such as breast augmentation, vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, orchiectomy, or facial feminization) Do All Transgender People Have Surgery? Despite what many people think, a person does not have to undergo medical treatments to be transgender. Social and/or legal affirmation may be far more important to some people. While many transgender people will take hormones to align their physical expression with their gender identity, there are many who don't and have no desire to. Terminology and Appropriate Usage Transgender is an adjective (as in "he is a transgender man"). It is not used as a noun (such as "he is a transgender")" or a verb ("he is transgendered"). "Trans" is often used as a shorthand for transgender, so it is usually acceptable to describe a transgender man as a trans man and a transgender woman as a trans woman. If someone identifies as transgender, you would typically use the pronouns "he" and "him" for a transgender man and "she" and "her" for a transgender woman. Even so, non-binary or gender-non-conforms people may prefer "them" and "they" or other pronouns, so ask first if you are unsure. If in doubt, err on the side of caution by offering your pronouns first and then asking the person what pronouns they use. Mistakes can occur, but to intentionally or repeatedly use the wrong pronouns is a disrespectful act known as misgendering. Equally disrespectful is calling someone by their "dead name" (their name prior to gender affirmation) rather than their "affirmed name." This is true even if you're a family member or have grown up with that person. Terms to Avoid There are other terms that have been displaced because they mischaracterize was being transgender is about. Others still are considered offensive and should never be used. These include: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Biological sex: "Biological" is often construed to mean authentic as in "biologically male" or "biologically female." It also suggests that genitals are physical and gender identity is somehow psychological. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender-confirming: A transgender person does not need to confirm or "prove" their gender. A transgender person affirms their gender by asserting their authentic self. Gender-affirming surgery is preferred, for example, over gender-confirming surgery. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender reassignment: In the same vein, a transgender person's gender is not changed or reassigned. This is especially true if you are non-binary and identify as neither male nor female. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Sex change: This is an outdated and largely offensive term that suggests that being transgender is about changing one's genitals. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transsexual: This is another outdated and offensive term that equates transgender identity with surgery, such as when describing a "pre-op transsexual" and "post-op transsexual." aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Tranny, She-Male, or She-He: These are defamatory terms used to dehumanize transgender people. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transgenderism: This is a term used by anti-trans activists that suggests that there is a movement to "recruit" or "push" people toward becoming transgender. What to Know About Metoidioplasty (Bottom Surgery) Discrimination and Transphobia It is estimated that about 0.5% of adults in the United States (1.3 million) and 1.4% of youth between the ages of 13 and 17 years (or 300,000) identify as transgender. Studies have shown that being transgender in the United States is fraught with challenges, including transphobia and discrimination in all realms of employment, education, healthcare, safety, and daily living. The National Transgender Discrimination Survey is the largest survey to assess the experiences of transgender people in the United States. It has been performed twiceâ€”first in 2008 with 6,450 respondents and then in 2013 with more than 27,000 Both reports described high rates of discrimination across every facet of life. Discrimination took the form of everything from verbal harassment to sexual assault, and many individuals were forced to leave school or jobs as a result of those experiences. Transgender individuals also reported many experiences of discrimination in health care. Many individuals were denied access to gender-affirming medical and surgical care. Perhaps even more disturbing, numerous people reported being denied access to emergency care and general medical care as well as verbal and physical harassment in healthcare spaces. Because of this, many transgender people report avoiding medical care, for fear of experiencing additional discrimination or abuse. Others report avoiding care because they lacked financial or other resources. Among the key statistics: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls One in six trans children has had to leave or change schools due to mistreatment. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls One in four trans children has been physically attacked. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls One in eight trans children has been sexually assaulted. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Nearly half of all trans people were sexually assaulted over the course of their lifetime. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls One in three trans adults has been fired, denied a promotion, or experienced mistreatment in the workplace due to their gender expression. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls One in three trans people has experienced mistreatment in healthcare, ranging from the refusal of service to verbal, physical, or sexual abuse. Discrimination is even worse for transgender people of color, who may experience bias based on both their skin color and their gender identity. The survey found that Latinx, American Indian, multiracial, and Black respondents were more than three times as likely as the general U.S. population to be living in poverty. How to Be an Ally Gender diversity is a normal part of a functioning society and has been reported throughout history. Although transgender individuals have an increased risk of certain negative health outcomes, research suggests that this does not reflect any inherent issue with being transgender. Instead, it reflects the minority stress related to being part of a society that may not be accepting. Indeed, research suggests that one of the most important factors associated with the health of transgender people is access to an affirming environment and desired medical care. This is particularly true for transgender children and adolescents, who have been shown to do as well as their cisgender peers when their families are supportive and accepting. While not all transgender individuals are interested in medical or surgical affirmation, all people need health care at some point during their lives. Therefore, it is important to make all healthcare facilities safe and affirming for people of diverse genders. Lack of access to affirming health care is a risk factor for health concerns for transgender people of all ages. 7 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Gender expression Gender expression, as opposed to gender identity, is what is on the outside. It is how people express their gender to others. All people make daily choices about what clothes to wear; whether and how to use or not use accessories, jewelry, and/or makeup; and how their hair is cut or styled. Most people have a specific look or style that is personally comfortable. This may also include how individuals walk, sit, or carry themselves. In the United States, women and men often are expected to make appearance-related choices from mutually exclusive sets of options. For example, although women may wear feminine-tailored clothing, use makeup, have a feminine hairstyle, and act "femininely," these gender expressions are very rarely considered acceptable for men. Other examples include separate women's and men's clothing departments, jewelry and watch display cases, and hygiene-related store shelves. A growing number of non-transgender individuals are breaking traditional gender norms. Male goth youth, for example, wear eyeliner and fingernail polish; business women wear pantsuits without makeup or jewelry; metrosexual men use moisturizing products and get manicures. Although gender expression is less rigid with each passing year, in large part expectations to conform to the stereotypes remain in place. Transgender people may decide to consistently present as male or female in alignment with societal norms. They may also deliberately choose both male and female gender expressions and thus have mixed, gender non-conforming, or genderfluid presentation. Some are more fluid about their gender expression, which they may change from day to day, hour to hour, or setting to setting either because they feel they have to (e.g., an individual chooses not to transition at work) or because they want to. What's That Mean? aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls FTM aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls MTF Some transgender people express gender in very traditional or overt ways to better "pass" as the gender with which they identify. For example, a male-to-female (MTF) transgender person may always wear skirts and stereotypically feminine blouses, paired with matching earrings and pristine makeup. A female-to-male (FTM) individual may wear a pressed oxford shirt and tie, dress pants and buffed shoes, and neatly trimmed short hair. In these cases, there is an intentional effort to send very clear, gendered messages to others. Often, as people are in the process of figuring out what feels most comfortable for themselves, they may experiment with styles and looks. They may later relax into more comfortable clothes, or clothes that reflect their own personal sense of style, rather than basing their choices on rigid cultural norms. Body image can play a role in how people express their gender. Transgender people generally have an even more uncomfortable or negative relationship with their bodies than non-transgender people. Some create a literal armor to hide or alter their bodies or to create a different bodily contour: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Some FTMs (or other people on the trans-masculine spectrum)— aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Bind their chests. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Wear baggy or multiple layers of clothing to help flatten the appearance of their chest. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Wear self-made or store-bought penile prosthetics. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Use prosthetics to allow them to urinate while standing. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Slouch or intentionally gain weight to add mass to their midsection, altering their feminine contour.

Safety can also be a major component of how gender is expressed. More detail about safety is found in the Passing section of this e-pub. Back to Top Hormones Some transgender people—but by no means all—use hormones as part of their medical transition. According to the National Center for Transgender Equality's (NCTE) groundbreaking study of 6,450 transgender individuals, 62 percent of respondents have had some hormone therapy and 23 percent hope to have it in the future.^10 Hormones are available in injectable, pill, patch, and gel/cream formats. Hormones help shift bodies into a more traditionally masculine or feminine form. Using testosterone, for example, can deepen the voice, activate facial and body hair growth, redistribute fat, cause the clitoris to enlarge, and may stimulate male pattern balding. Vaginal tissue typically becomes more fragile and less elastic and may not lubricate easily. The vaginal opening may become smaller and tighter, especially if the person does not use their vagina for consensual sexual penetration. Testosterone use usually, but not always, results in the cessation of menstrual cycles and renders the individual infertile. Using estrogen, progesterone, and anti-androgens can cause breast growth, reduce body hair, redistribute body fat, soften the skin, cause some loss of muscle mass, and increase the risk of blood clots, particularly following surgery and in people who smoke. Although mood swings are a typical side effect of hormones in the first few years of use, people who use them frequently report that hormones make them calmer and happier.^11 Because some of the changes from hormone use are permanent, some transgender people stop using hormones once they have achieved specific physical goals. Others stop for health reasons or because they become unable to afford hormones (which may not be covered by health insurance, even for those who have insurance). Others continue lifelong use, which is generally recommended for anyone who no longer generates their own hormones due to a hysterectomy (removal of the ovaries and uterus) or orchiectomy (removal of the testes), or due to age (when hormone levels naturally decline). People can acquire hormones from a health care provider or clinic—the safest method—but they may also get them on the street, from friends, or online (frequently without any medical supervision or monitoring). Non-physician prescribed hormones are relatively common due to a lack of access to health care, an inability to afford physician visits and routine laboratory tests, a preference not to see a physician, or a preference to avoid or an inability to afford psychotherapy, which a physician may require prior to prescribing hormones.^12 Silicone Some MTFs inject silicone to feminize their bodies. Silicone use is particularly prevalent among MTFs involved in the sex trade because it creates a feminine appearance without the use of hormones, which may limit erectile function and reduce their employment options.^13 Although injected silicone has an immediate outcome, it also carries many serious health risks, including migration of the silicone away from the desired area, systemic illness, and even death.^14 In addition, because injection often happens in peer-based group settings and in less-than-sterile environments, needles may be re-used or shared, increasing the risk of acquiring HIV, hepatitis, and other blood-borne infections. Note: FTMs may also use silicone to alter the shape and contour of their bodies. If people acquire hormones through a health care provider, that provider should monitor the individuals' laboratory results and physical wellness. Many providers adhere to a standard of care to guide their treatment of transgender patients, which requires that a mental health professional also be involved.^15 Most standards of care require that transgender clients participate in therapy for a time, typically 3 months to 1 year, after which the mental health care provider will write a letter stating that the client is ready to start medical treatment. This "gatekeeping" model can create additional challenges. For example, transgender people who visit mental health professionals may omit certain details about their lives out of fear that they will be denied the letter required by the standard of care. Past traumas, current mental health issues, or drug or alcohol use are generally known to have been used as justification for withholding these letters. A growing number of LGBT community health clinics and individual providers, however, are moving from standards of care to informed consent models of care, giving both transgender patients and providers more flexibility, autonomy, and control over the health care process.^16 The risks associated with medically supervised hormone use are in line with the risks of many other medications. Routine monitoring, moderate dosing, a healthy lifestyle (e.g., exercise, healthy diet, adequate rest, low-to-moderate stress), and well-managed medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, other common or rare conditions) help to minimize the risks associated with hormone use. Economics, access to medical care, and access to physicians who are willing to prescribe hormones often influence how and whether people obtain hormones as a part of their medical transition. Back to Top Surgery Non-transgender people frequently believe there is one "transgender surgery," which involves the genitals. The reality is that there is no "one" surgery and that multiple options or combinations of surgeries can help people change their bodies to be more closely in line with their gender identity. As with hormone use, health care providers operating under standards of care may require their transgender clients to participate in therapy before surgery. In fact, surgeons specializing in gender-related surgeries often require letters from two mental health professionals rather than just one. The following data on surgeries were taken from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey conducted in 2011^17: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls The most common FTM surgeries are mastectomy or chest reconstruction (41 percent) and hysterectomy (20 percent). Few have phalloplasty (construction of a penis) (2 percent) or other genital surgery (e.g., metoidioplasty and/or construction of testes) (3 percent) because of their high cost and frequent complications, and dissatisfaction with the results. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls MTF surgeries can involve breast augmentation (18 percent), facial feminization surgery (e.g., creating a less prominent brow or chin, shaving the Adams apple), vaginoplasty (creating a vagina) (20 percent), and/or removal of the testes (21 percent). Because of the danger of attracting anti-transgender violence in public, some transgender women consider breast augmentation and facial feminization surgeries higher priorities than genital surgery. Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Cutting, or non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as a way of coping with abuse and stress is common among transgender people. In a study of 977 individuals, almost 42 percent had a history of NSSI, as compared to 4â€“38 percent in the non-transgender population. FTMs had substantially higher rates of NSSI. Of transgender people who were prevented from transitioning (denied letters for hormones or surgery), 50 percent had a history of NSSI.^18 Genital surgery, as noted above, is far more common for MTFs than FTMs. The difference in function and aesthetics may be among the reasons for this disparity, as well as the difference in cost for vaginoplasty (cheaper) versus phalloplasty (much more expensive). On rare occasions, some transgender people who have been unable to access surgeries due to cost and/or surgeons' refusals to operate have attempted self-surgery to remove their breasts, penis, or testicles. Contrary to popular belief, many transgender people do not feel the need to surgically alter their bodies. For that reason, combined with prohibitive costs, lack of access, and worries about functionality and aesthetics, FORGE believes that most transgender people do not have gender-related surgery. This underlying belief is supported by the National Transgender Discrimination Survey's broad sample of transgender individuals and their experiences and desires with/for surgery.^19 Back to Top Office of Justice Programs logo Web Site Links Disclaimer OVC Home | Reuse Policy | OVC TTAC | FAQs | Contact Us | Site Map | Archive | Link to Us DOJ Home | OJP Home | CrimeSolutions.gov | GMS | Grants.gov | Privacy Policy | Language Access Legal Policies and Disclaimers | FOIA | USA.gov Office for Victims of Crime 810 Seventh Street NW., Washington, DC 20531 The Office for Victims of Crime is a component of the Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice.

In its original and narrower sense, transgender referred to males and females who respectively gender-identify as females and males. In a later and broader sense, it has come to designate persons whose gender identities incorporate behaviours and traits traditionally associated with the opposite sex. Transgender persons may thus include transsexuals, transgenderists (in one usage of the term, persons who gender-identify with the opposite sex but who choose not to undergo sex-reassignment surgery or hormone treatments), and androgynes (biologically or psychologically androgynous persons), among other groups. In its broader sense, transgender is closely related to the more-recent term genderqueer, which is self-applied by persons who are either transgender or who have no gender, a third (neither male nor female) gender, or a fluctuating gender.

(BUTTON) (more) See all videos for this article In part because there is no universally accepted definition of transgender (different researchers use the term in different ways), it is uncertain how many transgender persons there are. Estimates in the United States, based on the broad definition used in this article, have varied from less than 1 percent to more than 3 percent of the population in the early 21st century. Sex, gender, and sexual orientation The notion of transgender presupposes fundamental distinctions between the concepts of sex, gender, and sexual orientation (see human sexual behaviour). Whereas sex is a biological category, gender refers to the set of traits and behaviours that are traditionally associated with a particular sex. A person who is transgender experiences and expresses a disjunction between sex and gender. Sexual orientation, in contrast, is defined in terms of the sexes or genders to which a person is sexually, emotionally, or romantically attracted. It is a widespread but mistaken assumption that transgender persons are necessarily homosexual (i.e., attracted to members of the sex that they were assigned at birth). Although some are homosexual, others are heterosexual or bisexual or do not identify with any particular sexual orientation. Theoretical background Various theories of gender have been proposed as explanations of the experience of transgender persons. In addition to the concepts of sex and gender, those of gender identity and gender expression are particularly important for such theories. Gender identity refers to a personâ€™s self-identification as male or female or as something in between or outside of those categories. Gender expression refers to the behaviour through which one expresses oneâ€™s gender identityâ€”e.g., by using certain pronouns or wearing certain kinds of clothing or having a particular hairstyle. Whereas gender identity is not something that others can view, gender expression is publicly visible. The main theories of gender are essentialism, social constructionism, and performativity. Essentialists place emphasis on biological characteristics, arguing that a personâ€™s gender identity is fixed at birth, whether or not it corresponds to biological sex. Essentialism is thus opposed to the view that gender identity is entirely socially constructedâ€”i.e., a product of social or societal influences. The central case in need of explanation, according to essentialists, is that of persons who report having always (for as long as they can remember) felt that they belonged to the sex opposite the one that they were assigned at birth. Such experiences are typical of transsexuals, who feel the need to change their sex to match the gender identity they feel they have always had. Social constructionism, as the term suggests, is the view that gender is socially constructed. That gender is socially constructed is shown, according to constructionists, by the fact that the traits and behaviours traditionally associated with the male or female sex have varied over time and across cultures, which would not be the case if gender were innate. It is important to note that essentialism and social constructivism, as those theories are defined in this article, are not necessarily inconsistent, insofar as they aim to explain different (though obviously related) things: the one concerns the supposed biological origin of gender identity (oneâ€™s self-identification as male or female), the other the supposed social or societal origin of gender (the traits and behaviours that make up the masculine or the feminine). It is entirely possible that the former is innate and the latter largely, if not entirely, learned, in the broad sense of being instilled.

A prominent defender of that view is the American philosopher Judith Butler, who is also known as a developer of the performative theory of gender. An extension of social constructivism is the performative theory, or performativity, which holds that gender is a â€œperformanceâ€ that people undertake on a daily basis, even if only unconsciously. In particular, gender is not the expression of an underlying essence or nature, whether based on sex or on gender identity. It is rather a series of acts whose constant repetition creates the illusion that an underlying nature exists. According to Butler, gender â€œis performatively constituted by the very â€˜expressionsâ€™ that are said to be its results.â€ Kimberly Tauches The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica IFRAME: //www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-5W6NC8

The new policy aligns transgender student-athlete participation with the Olympic Movement. The resulting sport-by-sport approach preserves opportunity for transgender student-athletes while balancing fairness, inclusion and safety for all who compete. Like the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, the updated NCAA policy calls for transgender student-athlete participation for each sport to be determined by the policy for the national governing body of that sport. If there is no NGB policy for a sport, it would then be determined by the policy for that sportâ€™s international federation. If there is no international federation policy, it would be determined by policy criteria previously established by the International Olympic Committee. Sport-specific polices are subject to ongoing review and recommendation by the NCAA Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports to the Board of Governors. The policy is effective immediately, with three phases of implementation. Phase One â€“ 2022 winter and spring championships For participation in 2022 winter and spring championships, transgender student-athletes were required to provide documentation to the CSMAS within four weeks before the selections date for their championship. The documentation had to demonstrate compliance with the 2010 NCAA policy, which calls for one year of testosterone suppression treatment. It also had to document a one-time serum testosterone level that fell below the maximum allowable level for the sport in which the student-athlete was competing within four weeks of championship selections for that sport. That means that student-athletes who already fulfilled the 2010 NCAA policy only needed provide one validated serum testosterone level. Transgender student-athletes who participated in regular season competition (including conference championships) remained subject to the 2010 NCAA policy only. Phase Two â€“ 2022-23 and 2023-24 regular season and championships Beginning Aug. 1, 2022, participation in NCAA sports requires transgender student-athletes to provide documentation that meets the above criteria for the 2010 NCAA policy, plus meet the sport standard for documented testosterone levels at three points in time: 1. Prior to any competition during the regular season; 2. Prior to the first competition in an NCAA championship event; and 3. Prior to any competition in the non-championship segment. See the transgender student-athlete eligibility review procedures for more information. Phase Three â€“ 2024-25 full implementation Beginning Aug. 1, 2024, participation in NCAA sports requires transgender student-athletes to provide documentation no less than twice annually (and at least once within four weeks of competition in NCAA championships) that meets the sport-specific standard (which may include testosterone levels, mitigation timelines and other aspects of sport-governing body policies) as reviewed and approved by CSMAS. More information about the specific application of Phase Three will be provided prior to implementation. Additional flexibility The Board of Governors urged the divisions to allow for additional, future eligibility if a transgender student-athlete loses eligibility based on the policy change, provided they meet the newly adopted standards. The NCAAâ€™s Office of Inclusion and Sport Science Institute also released the Gender Identity and Student-Athlete Participation Summit Final Report. The report assists ongoing membership efforts to support an inclusive environment that promotes and develops the mental and physical health of transgender and non-binary student-athletes in collegiate sport. The foundational principles in this report will be developed further in conjunction with the Committee to Promote Cultural Diversity and Equity, CSMAS and other core membership committees that address gender identity.

The Basics Who are Transgender People ? The Basics PubliÃ© le 10 fÃ©vrier 2010 - modifiÃ© le 17 fÃ©vrier 2010 Transgender is an « umbrella » term used to describe a wide range of identities and experiences, and is used to refer to many types of people, including transsexual people ; crossdressers ; androgynous people ; genderqueers ; and other gender non-conforming people whose appearance or characteristics are perceived to be gender atypical. In its broadest sense, « transgender » encompasses anyone whose identity or behavior falls outside stereotypical gender expectations. It is important to understand that some people may identify as transgender but not fall into one of the subcategories discussed here. This publication attempts to identify many of the ways in which transgender individuals identify and express themselves, but this listing is in no way complete. Furthermore, it is particularly important to realize that many individuals, despite the fact that they may appear transgender to some, do not consider themselves to be transgender. It is important that we not label people transgender based on our perceptions, but instead use the words they use to describe themselves. All people have a gender identity. Gender identity refers to a personâ€™s internal sense of being male, female or something else. For most people, oneâ€™s gender identity matches the sex assigned to them at birthâ€”for example, a person born female typically identifies as a girl, and later, as a woman. For many transgender people, there may not be a match. All people also have a gender expression. Gender expression refers to all of the ways that people express their gender (or gender identity) to the outside world, including through dress, appearance, and behavior. For many transgender people, their gender expression doesnâ€™t match what society thinks it should be. 10 TRANSITIONING OUR SHELTERS, SOME DEFINITIONS Transgender : An « umbrella » term for people whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth, including but not limited to transsexuals, crossdressers, androgynous people, genderqueers, and gender non-conforming people. Transgender is a broad term and is good for providers to use. Transgender Man : A term for a transgender individual who currently identifies as a man (see also « FTM »). Transgender Woman : A term for a transgender individual who currently identifies as a woman (see also « MTF »). Gender Identity : An individualâ€™s internal sense of being male, female, or something else. Since gender identity is internal, oneâ€™s gender identity is not necessarily visible to others. Gender Expression : How a person represents or expresses oneâ€™s gender identity to others, often through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, voice or body characteristics. Transsexual : A term for people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth. Often, but not always, transsexual people alter their bodies through hormones or surgery in order to make it match their gender identity. Cross-dresser : A term for people who dress in clothing traditionally or stereotypically worn by the other sex, but who generally have no intent to live full-time as the other gender. Transvestite : A term for a cross-dresser that is considered derogatory by many. Genderqueer : A term used by some individuals who identify as neither entirely male nor entirely female. Genderqueer is an identity more common among young people. Gender Non-conforming : A term for individuals whose gender expression is different from the societal expectations based on their assigned sex at birth. Bi-gendered : One who has a significant gender identity that encompasses both genders, male and female. Some may feel that one side or the other is stronger, but both sides are there. Two-spirit : The definition of a two-spirit person varies across the Native American cultures in which they appear. In general, two-spirit people are born one sex, and end up fulfilling the roles assigned to both sexes, or other roles reserved for two-spirit people. Some people consider two-spirit a term that can refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, while others think it is best used only for transgender people. FTM : A person who has transitioned from « female-to-male, » meaning a person who was assigned female at birth, but now identifies and lives as a male. Also known as a « transgender man. » MTF : A person who has transitioned from « male-to-female, » meaning a person who was assigned male at birth, but now identifies and lives as a female. Also known as a « transgender woman. » Passing : A term used by transgender people to mean that they are seen as the gender they self-identify as. For example, a transgender man (born female) who most people see as a man. Sex Reassignment Surgery : Surgical procedures that change oneâ€™s body to make it conform to a personâ€™s gender identity. This may include « top surgery » (breast augmentation or removal) or « bottom surgery » (altering genitals). Contrary to popular belief, there is not one surgery ; in fact there are many different surgeries. « Sex change surgery » is considered a derogatory term by many. Sexual Orientation : A term describing a personâ€™s attraction to members of the same sex or different sex. Usually defined as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or heterosexual. Transition : The period during which a person begins to live as their new gender. Transitioning may include changing oneâ€™s name, taking hormones, having surgery, or changing legal documents (e.g. driverâ€™s license, Social Security number, birth certificate) to reflect their new gender. Intersex : A term used for people who are born with external genitalia, chromosomes, or internal reproductive systems that are not traditionally associated with either a « standard » male or female. Drag Queen : generally used to accurately refer to men who dress as women (often celebrity women) for the purpose of entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events. It is also used as slang, sometimes in a derogatory manner, to refer to all transgender women. Drag King : used to refer to women who dress as men for the purpose of entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events. These definitions are influenced by a variety of sources.

Gender-affirming surgeries may include: chest reconstructive surgeries (e.g., double mastectomy, feminizing mammoplasty), genital reconstructive surgeries (e.g., orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, metoidioplasty, phalloplasty), facial feminization surgeries (e.g., tracheal shave, rhinoplasty, brow lift), or other procedures (e.g., vocal cord surgery). In California, surgery is not required to change oneâ€™s legal gender marker. Note: This term is preferred over the outdated term Sexual Reassignment Surgery (SRS). It is also preferred over the term gender confirmation surgery (GCS) because gender cannot be â€œconfirmedâ€ by having surgery. A personâ€™s gender is to be respected regardless of surgical history/status or what kind of genitals they have or had. It is best to avoid terms such as â€œpre-opâ€, â€œnon-opâ€, or â€œpost-op,â€ as they reinforce the assumption all trans people want to or will have the opportunity to have surgery. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender Dysphoria: Emotional distress related to the sense that oneâ€™s assigned sex is not in line with oneâ€™s gender identity.

Gender expression does not always correspond to gender identity. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender Identity: The inherent feeling within an individual of what gender they are; a person may identify as a man, woman, neither, in-between, both, or fluidly moving between these two binary categories. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Gender-Neutral Pronouns: Pronouns that a person may use when they do not fully identify with binary gender categories. Examples of gender-neutral pronouns include singular they/them/their, ey/em/eir, zie/hir/hirs, or no pronouns. Itâ€™s best to ask what pronouns are appropriate for them. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Genderqueer: A gender identity that denotes someone who does not fully identify with the binary genders of male/man/masculine or female/woman/feminine. A genderqueer person may identify as neither a man nor a woman, in-between, both, fluidly moving between these two categories, or as a third/alternate gender. Related to the term nonbinary, which has become more popular in the 2010â€™s. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Intersex: A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a physical characteristics (e.g., gonads, chromosomal makeup, external genitalia, internal reproductive or urinary organs) that do not fit typical medical or social definitions of female or male. Some people use the term DSD (Disorders of Sex Development) to describe intersex people, but this is not seen as affirming by intersex communities. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Nonbinary: A gender identity that denotes someone who does not fully identify with the binary genders of male/man/masculine or female/woman/feminine. A nonbinary person may identify as neither a man nor a woman, in-between, both, fluidly moving between these two categories, or as a third/alternate gender. Related to the term genderqueer, which was used more often prior to the 2010â€™s. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Passing: Being perceived as cisgender or as a gender in line with oneâ€™s gender identity. This term is not considered affirming to many, as it implies that trans people are deceptive or are not truly the gender they say they are. Passing is important to some people (e.g., for safety reasons), but it is not the goal of every trans person. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Queer: Used to describe non-normative identities (both sexual identities and gender identities) that might not easily be classified under other terminology (gay, lesbian, etc.). Queer can also be used as an umbrella term to describe LGBTQIA identities as a whole. In many communities, the term â€œqueerâ€ also has a political connotation that is connected to LGBTQIA activism. The term queer may be offensive to older LGBTQIA individuals, so it is best to use caution and only use this term when you know that someone uses it as an affirming term to describe themselves. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Sexual Orientation: A way to describe a personâ€™s romantic and/or sexual attractions to others. Sexual orientation may consist of attraction, behavior, and identity, and not all of these factors need to be aligned/consistent. For example, a person may have attractions towards trans women, be sexually active with cisgender men, and have an identity as heterosexual. Some labels to describe sexual orientation include: heterosexual, straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer, or fluid. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transgender, Trans: An adjective to describe someone who does not fully identify with the sex they were assigned at birth. These terms are often used as umbrella terms for more specific terms that people within trans communities use to describe themselves (and sometimes a person may use several to describe themselves). Some of these terms include: + Man + Woman + Transgender man, trans man, trans masculine + Transgender woman, trans woman, trans feminine + Genderqueer + Bigender + Gender neutral + Demi-boy + Demi-girl + Agender + Genderless + Neutrois + Pangender + Itâ€™s best to ask how a transgender person identifies. Be aware that the word â€œtrannyâ€ is considered offensive. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transgender Man, Trans Man, Trans Masculine: Someone who was female assigned at birth who identifies as a man or on the masculine spectrum. Note: The term FTM is no longer considered affirming. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transgender Woman, Trans Woman, Trans Feminine: Someone who was male assigned at birth who identifies as a woman or on the feminine spectrum. Note: The term MTF is no longer considered affirming. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transition: The process of shifting oneâ€™s gender identity and/or expression. Transition is a process that occurs over time, varies greatly among individuals, and may consist of physical/medical, emotional, social, and legal components. There is no uniform or set path for how a person transitions, if at all. Some transgender people consider themselves post-transition, and some no longer consider themselves to be transgender. Others feel that they are in a state of transition for the rest of their lives. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transsexual: A term that was commonly used before the term â€œtransgenderâ€ came into more popular usage in the 1990â€™s. Some people still identify as transsexual, but this term is no longer considered affirming.

These human rights defenders put their safety on the line every day to lead organizations that stand up for the human rights and health of LGBTIQ communities. Far too often, they are doing it alone. You can be a part of changing that. Help us get LGBTIQ organizations the funds they need. The SLFâ€™s Partners in Pride campaign supports these organizations, which are lifelines for their communities. They provide vital services, including health care, mental health supports, social supports, and legal counsel. Donate Now The last year has been a difficult one for our LGBTIQ partner organizations. Widespread discrimination, pervasive stigma, and barriers to social and legal support have led to human rights violations and exacerbated the impacts of HIV on LGBTIQ communities. Yet, our LGBTIQ partners continue to provide life-saving programs and to fight for the right to exist free from stigma, discrimination, and criminalization. â€œWe are driven by the conviction that we are part of a larger story of global human rights, and we will not give up until we have built the future we deserve.â€ â€“ Frank Mugisha Learn more about our 13 LGBTIQ grassroots partners in our Partners in Pride Impact Report 2023.

Biggie is a social justice warrior and activist who is unapologetic about her work with the LGBTIQ community, standing up to stigma and discrimination often imposed by politicians and religious leaders who cling to colonial-era, anti-LGBTIQ laws that encourage hatred and curtail human rights.

What does transgender mean? Transgender is a term used to describe people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Gender identity is a personâ€™s internal, personal sense of being a man or a woman (or boy or girl.) For some people, their gender identity does not fit neatly into those two choices. For transgender people, the sex they were assigned at birth and their own internal gender identity do not match. People in the transgender community may describe themselves using one (or more) of a wide variety of terms, including (but not limited to) transgender, transsexual, and non-binary. Always use the term used by the person. Trying to change a personâ€™s gender identity is no more successful than trying to change a personâ€™s sexual orientation â€” it doesnâ€™t work. So most transgender people seek to bring their bodies into alignment with their gender identity. This is called transition. As part of the transition process, many transgender people are prescribed hormones by their doctors to change their bodies. Some undergo surgeries as well. But not all transgender people can or will take those steps, and itâ€™s important to know that being transgender is not dependent upon medical procedures. Transgender is an adjective and should never be used as a noun. For example, rather than saying â€œMax is a transgender,â€ say â€œMax is a transgender personâ€ or â€œMax is a transgender man.â€ And transgender never needs an â€œ-edâ€ at the end. How is sexual orientation different from gender identity? We use the acronym LGBTQ to describe the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer community. The Q can also sometimes mean questioning. Sexual orientation describes a personâ€™s enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to another person (for example: straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual), while gender identity describes a personâ€™s, internal, personal sense of being a man or a woman, or someone outside of the gender binary. Simply put: sexual orientation is about who you are attracted to and fall in love with; gender identity is about who you are. Like everyone else, transgender people have a sexual orientation. Transgender people may be straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer. For example, a person who transitions from male to female and is attracted solely to men would typically identify as a straight woman. A person who transitions from female to male and is attracted solely to men would typically identify as a gay man. What does non-binary mean, and is it different from being transgender? Everyone has a gender identity, an internal sense of self and perception of oneâ€™s own gender. For some people their gender identity is the same as the sex they were assigned at birth (cisgender) and for some people their gender identity is different than the sex they were assigned at birth (transgender). There have always been transgender people who felt that their gender identity didnâ€™t fall neatly into the two binary categories of â€œmanâ€ or â€œwoman.â€ In the past, trans people who felt that way used the words genderqueer and genderfluid to describe that experience. While those words are still used today, itâ€™s now more common for people to call themselves non-binary if they feel their gender identity is something other than â€œmanâ€ or â€œwoman.â€ People who use the word non-binary to describe their gender identity typically also call themselves transgender. In recent years, the word non-binary has seen a surge in popularity. As more people use the word non-binary to describe themselves, it has become its own umbrella term. Non-binary now means many different things to different people. Many of those people either explictly say something like, â€œIâ€™m not transgender, Iâ€™m non-binary,â€ implying those are two identities are unrelated, or they will simply never use the word transgender when describing themselves. Language is evolving in real time. But itâ€™s important to understand that there is no one right or wrong way to be non-binary, just like there is no right or wrong way to be transgender. The bottom line is: listen to how someone uses the word non-binary to describe themselves and try to understand how they are using it. Many of them will be telling you that they are a transgender person who is non-binary, while others will be using non-binary in a different way to describe their experience. Regardless, simply accept that they know best how to describe themselves. What name and pronoun do I use? For some transgender people, being associated with their birth name is a tremendous source of anxiety, or it is simply a part of their life they wish to leave behind. Respect the name a transgender person is currently using. If you happen to know a transgender personâ€™s birth name (the name given to them when they were born, but which they no longer use), donâ€™t share it without that personâ€™s explicit permission. Sharing a transgender personâ€™s birth name and/or photos of a transgender person before their transition is an invasion of privacy, unless they have given you permission to do so. If youâ€™re unsure which pronoun a person uses, listen first to the pronoun other people use when referring to that person. Someone who knows the person well will probably use the correct pronoun. If you must ask which pronoun the person uses, start with your own. For example, â€œHi, Iâ€™m Alex and I use the pronouns he and him. What about you?â€ Then use that personâ€™s pronoun and encourage others to do the same. If you accidentally use the wrong pronoun for someone, apologize quickly and sincerely, then move forward with intention. The bigger deal you make out of the situation, the more uncomfortable it is for everyone. How do I treat a transgender person with respect?

But for transgender women who live there it had seemed light years away until a rapprochement with the Catholic Church that began during the COVID-19 lockdown and led to an invitation to have lunch with Pope Francis on Sunday. Claudia Victoria Salas, 55, and Carla Segovia, 46, both Argentinian, were in a group of transgender people, among about 1,200 poor and homeless people, who attended the lunch on the Church's World Day of the poor. To her surprise, Salas, a former sex worker, found herself seated opposite the pope, who is also Argentinian, at the main table in the auditorium, where the pontiff holds his general audiences in winter. "We transgenders here in Italy feel a bit more human because the fact that Pope Francis brings us closer to the Church is a beautiful thing," Carla Segovia, 46, a sex worker, said earlier this week on the deserted windy beach of Torvaianica. "Because we need some love," she said. Last week, the Vatican's doctrinal office issued a statement saying transgender people can be godparents at Roman Catholic baptisms, witnesses at religious weddings and receive baptism themselves.

REUTERS/Antonio Denti Acquire Licensing Rights (BUTTON) (BUTTON) LGBT rights advocates in the church welcomed the move while conservatives condemned it, accusing Francis of sending confusing signals about sexual morality to the faithful. Francis, 86, has tried to make the Church more welcoming to the LGBT community without changing Church teachings, including one saying that same-sex attraction is not sinful but same-sex acts are. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Father Andrea Conocchia, the pastor of the Blessed Immaculate Virgin parish in Torvaianica helped the transgender community with food and other assistance. Parish resources were stretched at the time because many people were cut off from income, so Conocchia asked for help from the cardinal who runs the pope's charities. As well as sending money, the cardinal arranged for them to have COVID vaccinations in the Vatican and to meet the pope. "For us, he is our saint," Salas said of Conocchia last week. On Sunday, Conocchia arrived at the Vatican on a bus with about 50 poor from his parish, including transgender people, both foreign born and Italian. "This is a fantastic opportunity for all of us transsexuals," Segovia said, as she entered the auditorium. "I send the pope a big kiss".

That means my birth certificate said 'male,' but I always knew I was a girl. I was so relieved when I told my mom about how I felt â€“ and instead of being mad, she was supportive." - Grace] ["Though my birth certificate said female, I have always felt like a boy. I kept it inside for many years, spending countless sleepless nights being terrified of what my family and friends would think and worrying about being rejected at school. I finally transitioned to the man I am today when I was 20 years old. Though I have faced discrimination by many people since then, I have also received invaluable support. That is what keeps me going." - Alex] Understanding what it is like to be transgender can be hard, especially if you have never met a transgender person. Transgender is a broad term that can be used to describe people whose gender identity is different from the gender they were thought to be when they were born. â€œTransâ€ is often used as shorthand for transgender. To treat a transgender person with respect, you treat them according to their gender identity, not their sex at birth. So, someone who lives as a woman today is called a transgender woman and should be referred to as â€œsheâ€ and â€œher.â€ A transgender man lives as a man today and should be referred to as â€œheâ€ and â€œhim.â€ (Note: NCTE uses both the adjectives â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemaleâ€ and the nouns â€œmanâ€ and â€œwomanâ€ to refer to a personâ€™s gender identity.) Gender identity is your internal knowledge of your gender â€“ for example, your knowledge that youâ€™re a man, a woman, or another gender. Gender expression is how a person presents their gender on the outside.That might include behavior, clothing, hairstyle, voice or body characteristics. Everyone has a gender identity, including cisgender â€“ or non-transgender â€“ people. If someoneâ€™s gender identity matches the gender they were assigned at birth, then they are cisgender, or â€œcis" for short. Sex is often used in a medical or scientific contexts. Sex is a label â€” male or female â€” that youâ€™re assigned by a doctor at birth based on the appearance of the genitals youâ€™re born with. It doesnâ€™t define who you are, or what your gender identity might turn out to be. When a person begins to live according to their gender identity, rather than the gender they were thought to be when they were born, this time period is called gender transition. Deciding to transition can take a lot of reflection. Many transgender people risk social stigma, discrimination, and harassment when they tell other people who they really are. Despite those risks, being open about oneâ€™s gender identity can be life-affirming and even life-saving. Possible steps in a gender transition may or may not include changing your clothing, appearance, name, or the pronoun people use to refer to you (like â€œshe,â€ â€œhe,â€ or â€œtheyâ€). If they can, some people change their identification documents, like their driverâ€™s license or passport, to better reflect their gender. And some people undergo hormone therapy or other medical procedures to change their physical characteristics and make their body match the gender they know themselves to be. All transgender people are entitled to the same dignity and respect, regardless of whether or not they have been able to take any legal or medical steps. Some transgender people identify as neither a man nor a woman, or as a combination of male and female, and may use terms like nonbinary or genderqueer to describe their gender identity. Those who are nonbinary often prefer to be referred to as â€œtheyâ€ and â€œthem.â€ It is important to use respectful terminology, and treat transgender people as you would treat any other person. This includes using the name the person has asked you to call them (not their old name) as well as the pronouns they want you to use. If you arenâ€™t sure what pronouns a person uses, just ask politely. __________________________________________________________________ Visit our About Transgender People resource hub for more information!

Resources 2. Understanding the Transgender Community Understanding the Transgender Community Produced by the HRC Foundation Share on Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Transgender people come from all walks of life, and HRC Foundation has estimated that there are more than 2 million of us across the United States. We are parents, siblings, and kids. We are your coworkers, your neighbors, and your friends. We are 7-year-old children and 70-year-old grandparents. We are a diverse community, representing all racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as all faith traditions. Leer en EspaÃ±ol The word â€œtransgenderâ€ â€“ or trans â€“ is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity is different from the sex assigned to us at birth. Although the word â€œtransgenderâ€ and our modern definition of it only came into use in the late 20th century, people who would fit under this definition have existed in every culture throughout recorded history. Alongside the increased visibility of trans celebrities like Laverne Cox, Jazz Jennings or the stars of the hit Netflix series â€œPose,â€ three out of every ten adults in the U.S. personally knows someone who is trans. As trans people become more visible, we aim to increase understanding of our community among our friends, families, and society. What does it mean to be trans? The trans community is incredibly diverse. Some trans people identify as trans men or trans women, while others may describe themselves as non-binary, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, agender, bigender or other identities that reflect their personal experience. Some of us take hormones or have surgery as part of our transition, while others may change our pronouns or appearance. Roughly three-quarters of trans youth that responded to an HRC Foundation and University of Connecticut survey identified with terms other than strictly â€œboyâ€ or â€œgirl.â€ This suggests that a larger portion of this generationâ€™s youth are identifying somewhere on the broad trans spectrum. What challenges do trans people face? While trans people are increasingly visible in both popular culture and in daily life, we still face severe discrimination, stigma and systemic inequality. Some of the specific issues facing the trans community are: aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Lack of legal protectionâ€“ Trans people face a legal system that often does not protect us from discrimination based on our gender identity. Despite a recent U.S. Supreme Court Decision that makes it clear that trans people are legally protected from discrimination in the workplace, there is still no comprehensive federal non-discrimination law that includes gender identity - which means trans people may still lack recourse if we face discrimination when weâ€™re seeking housing or dining in a restaurant. Moreover, state legislatures across the country are debating â€“ and in some cases passing â€“ legislation specifically designed to prohibit trans people from accessing public bathrooms that correspond with our gender identity, or creating exemptions based on religious beliefs that would allow discrimination against LGBTQ people. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Povertyâ€“ Trans people live in poverty at elevated rates, and for trans people of color, these rates are even higher. Around 29% of trans adults live in poverty, as well 39% of Black trans adults, 48% of Latinx trans adults and 35% of Alaska Native, Asian, Native Americans and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander trans adults. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Stigma, Harassment and Discrimination â€“ About half a decade ago, only one-quarter of people in the United States supported trans rights, and support increased to 62% by the year 2019. Despite this progress, the trans community still faces considerable stigma due to more than a century of being characterized as mentally ill, socially deviant and sexually predatory. While these intolerant views have faded in recent years for lesbians and gay men, trans people are often still ridiculed by a society that does not understand us. This stigma plays out in a variety of contexts â€“ from lawmakers who leverage anti-trans stigma to score cheap political points; to family, friends or coworkers who reject trans people upon learning about our trans identities; and to people who harass, bully and commit serious violence against trans people. This includes stigma that prevents them from accessing necessary services for their survival and well-being. Only 30% of womenâ€™s shelters are willing to house trans women. While recent legal progress has been made, 27% of trans people have been fired, not hired or denied a promotion due to their trans identity. Too often, harassment has led trans people to avoid exercising their most basic rights to vote. HRC Foundationâ€™s research shows that 49% of trans adults, and 55% of trans adults of color said they were unable to vote in at least one election in their life because of fear of or experiencing discrimination at the polls. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Violence Against Trans Peopleâ€“ Trans people experience violence at rates far greater than the average person. Over a majority (54%) of trans people have experienced some form of intimate partner violence, 47% have been sexually assaulted in their lifetime and nearly one in ten were physically assaulted in between 2014 and 2015. This type of violence can be fatal. At least 27 trans and gender non-conforming people have been violently killed in 2020 thus far, the same number of fatalities observed in 2019. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Lack of Healthcare Coverageâ€“ An HRC Foundation analysis found that 22% of trans people and 32% of trans people of color have no health insurance coverage. More than one-quarter (29%) of trans adults have been refused health care by a doctor or provider because of their gender identity. This sobering data reveals a healthcare system that fails to meet the needs of the trans community. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Identity Documents â€“ The widespread lack of accurate identity documents among trans people can have an impact on every aspect of their lives, including access to emergency housing or other public services. Without identification, one cannot travel, register for school or access many services that are essential to function in society. Many states do not allow trans people to update their identification documents to match their gender identity. Others require evidence of medical transition â€“ which can be prohibitively expensive and is not something that all trans people want â€“ as well as fees for processing new identity documents, which may make them unaffordable for some members of the trans community. While advocates continue working to remedy these disparities, change cannot come too soon for trans people. Visibility â€“ especially positive images of trans people in the media and society â€“ continues to make a critical difference for us; but visibility is not enough and can come with real risks to our safety, especially for those of us who are part of other marginalized communities. That is why the Human Rights Campaign is committed to continuing to support and advocate for the trans community, so that the trans Americans who are and will become your friends, neighbors, coworkers and family members have an equal chance to succeed and thrive. __________________________________________________________________ The Human Rights Campaign reports on news, events and resources of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation that are of interest to the general public and further our common mission to support the LGBTQ+ community.

Transgender â€“ or trans* for short â€“ is an umbrella term for those whose gender differs from that which they were assigned at birth. This includes binary trans people (trans men and trans women) and non-binary trans people, who may use descriptors like gender-queer, bi-gender, a-gender, or gender-fluid (though not all non-binary people use trans as a descriptor â€“ refer to our gender diversity pages for more information). Trans people may express their gender in a variety of ways and that may vary in certain contexts and at certain times. Therefore it is important to remember that there is no one way to â€˜beâ€™ trans as it can mean many different things to different people. Transition for some people may mean changing their name and choosing a pronoun that feels more appropriate â€“ a process that is often referred to as â€˜social transitionâ€™. For others, transition may involve gender affirming medical treatments, such as hormones and surgical interventions â€“ processes referred to as â€˜medical transitionâ€™. Many trans people experience a feeling of distress which is clinically termed â€˜dysphoriaâ€™. Dysphoria is experienced differently by different people and it can be both fixed (experienced consistently) and fluid (experienced partially or periodically). Some trans people report that their dysphoria is triggered when their gender is not affirmed by others (sometimes called â€˜misgenderingâ€™), whilst others report that certain contexts, clothing types or body parts trigger their dysphoria. It is important to acknowledge that not all distress trans people feel may be dysphoria: trans people often bear a load of systemic discrimination which can lead to poorer mental health outcomes. We still do not know what makes some people trans, just as we do not know what makes some people cis or lesbian or even interested in sports or arts. Some academic fields are interested in debating how variations in gender diversity came to be, but the only thing that is clear is that transgender people are safer and happier when allowed to express themselves in a manner consistent with their gender identity. The best way to support transgender people is to let them lead their process of transition, which may include a need for others to respect their choice of name and pronouns, and reinforce their right to affirm their gender. Transition is a deeply personal journey that is often limited by circumstances and access to resources. Medical transition, for instance, is tightly controlled and might be geographically or financially inaccessible for some people. Sometimes other health issues can prevent a transgender person from doing all the things they wish to do to reinforce their gender identity. The process of medically transitioning can also be a very gradual one and differs from person to person. This may include choosing some treatments for a period of time and then choosing to stop (for example, using hormone therapy for a year, and then ceasing). It is important not to force expectations on transgender people but to allow them autonomy over their own lives and treat them with respect. If medically transitioning for example, is not something a person would like to pursue, this does not make them any â€˜lessâ€™ trans, but simply means their transition may look different from what is often expected of transgender people. Many statistics show alarmingly high rates of depression, anxiety and suicidality within the transgender community. Mental illness is often not associated directly with being transgender, but with the stigma and discrimination that transgender people face in daily life. These same statistics also show better mental health outcomes for those who are able to transition, as well as those who engage with transgender communities.

This may be a gradual process and may be limited by personal circumstances. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Trans people may choose diverse ways of expressing their gender, which can be influenced by particular circumstances. It may take someone a while to find the most comfortable way of expressing their gender. Be respectful of where a transgender person is at, and be sensitive to how they are choosing to express themselves at a given time. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls It is very important to respect the names and pronouns trans people choose for themselves, especially if they do not fit societal views of male or female. aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Transition and gender affirmation are positive processes that are beneficial to the mental health of trans people. Mental illness in the trans community is rooted in discrimination and the inaccessibility of transition procedures that many trans people face.

DÃ©couvrez la campagne « Face Ã  lâ€™intolÃ©rance, Ã  nous de faire la diffÃ©rence ». Ã€ l'occasion de la JournÃ©e internationale de lutte contre l' (BUTTON) homophobie, la (BUTTON) transphobie et la biphobie du 17 mai 2022, mobilisons-nous autour de l'acceptation des minoritÃ©s sexuelles et la nÃ©cessitÃ© de faire cesser les discriminations et les violences. Ces expÃ©riences de discriminations et de violences ont des rÃ©percussions importantes sur leur vie, leur santÃ© physique et mentale. En tant quâ€™individus, citoyens, amis, ou familles de personnes LGBT, nous avons tous un rÃ´le Ã  jouer dans la lutte contre ces discriminations et ces violences. Face Ã  lâ€™intolÃ©rance, Ã  nous de faire la diffÃ©rence. (BUTTON) aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls (BUTTON) Accepter et accueillir les personnes LGBT. Au travail, Ã  l'Ã©cole, dans notre cercle familiale ou amical, nous avons tous les moyens de participer Ã  la crÃ©ation d'un environnement inclusif et bienveillant pour les personnes LGBT. Accepter l'autre comme il est, quelles que soient son orientation sexuelles ou son identitÃ© de genre, lui tendre la main : peu importe le contexte, nous pouvons tous agir pour faire cesser les discriminations et les violences homophobes et transphobes. Dans le cercle familial et amical Si lâ€™un de vos proches se confie Ã  vous sur son (BUTTON) homosexualitÃ© ou sa transidentitÃ©, et sur les difficultÃ©s quâ€™il rencontre au quotidien, il faut : aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls le soutenir et lui dire son soutien ; aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Ãªtre Ã  lâ€™Ã©coute de ses besoins ; aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls veiller Ã  ce quâ€™il soit respectÃ© ; aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls lâ€™orienter, voire lâ€™accompagner sâ€™il en exprime le besoin, vers des associations. Que nous ayons ou non un proche LGBT dans notre cercle familial ou amical, il est nÃ©cessaire de sâ€™interposer lorsquâ€™on est tÃ©moin dâ€™un propos ou dâ€™une violence LGBTphobe au sein de notre entourage. Ce qui peut sembler Ãªtre une « blague de mauvais goÃ»t » ou une « simple insulte » nâ€™est jamais sans consÃ©quences. Il faut montrer lâ€™exemple et sortir du silence afin de sensibiliser ses proches et faire cesser cette stigmatisation. Au travail Si lâ€™un de vos collÃ¨gues^4 soupÃonne ou fait face Ã  une (BUTTON) discrimination en raison de son (BUTTON) orientation sexuelle ou de son identitÃ© de genre, il faut : aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls le soutenir et lui dire ; aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Ãªtre Ã  lâ€™Ã©coute de sa situation et de ses besoins ; aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls veiller Ã  ce quâ€™il soit intÃ©grÃ© et respectÃ© dans lâ€™entreprise ; aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls en informer les ressources humaines, les reprÃ©sentants du personnel ou les dÃ©lÃ©guÃ©s syndicaux, voire la direction, et sâ€™assurer que les auteurs soient identifiÃ©s et sanctionnÃ©s en consÃ©quence. Que nous ayons un collÃ¨gue LGBT ou non dans notre entreprise, sâ€™interposer lorsquâ€™on est tÃ©moin dâ€™un propos ou dâ€™une violence LGBTphobe est une maniÃ¨re de faire la diffÃ©rence. Ce qui peut sembler Ãªtre une « blague de mauvais goÃ»t » ou une « simple insulte » (mÃªme si elle ne semble pas viser directement une personne LGBT) est en rÃ©alitÃ© un comportement qui alimente une forme de complaisance face Ã  la discrimination. Alors, le mieux est de montrer lâ€™exemple : sortir du silence pour sensibiliser ses collÃ¨gues et faire cesser ces violences, qui sont tout sauf anodines. 41% des employÃ©s entendent des expressions LGBTphobes au sein de leur organisation, de leur entreprise. Ã€ l'Ã©cole Il nâ€™est pas toujours facile de sâ€™affirmer Ã  lâ€™Ã©cole, au collÃ¨ge ou au lycÃ©e, ni mÃªme dans ses Ã©tudes supÃ©rieures. NÃ©anmoins, montrer son appui Ã  un camarade victime de violences ou de discriminations est un acte nÃ©cessaire, lÃ©gitime et courageux. Il existe Ã©galement dâ€™autres maniÃ¨res de sâ€™investir dans le soutien des LGBT, en menant des actions de sensibilisation, par exemple : aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls faire intervenir des associations en classe ; aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls organiser des journÃ©es dâ€™information et de discussion. Il est important dâ€™oser proposer de telles initiatives Ã  la direction de son Ã©tablissement. Elle saura Ãªtre Ã  lâ€™Ã©coute ! Si vous Ãªtes professeur et tÃ©moin ou victime de violence ou de discrimination LGBTphobe, parlez-en Ã  vos collÃ¨gues et Ã  votre hiÃ©rarchie. Ensemble, vous pourrez mettre en place des actions de sensibilisation pour les Ã©lÃ¨ves et ainsi agir pour faire cesser les discriminations au sein de votre Ã©tablissement. Des services dâ€™aide et dâ€™Ã©coute existent pour les Ã©lÃ¨ves et le corps enseignant. Lâ€™Ã‰ducation nationale met Ã©galement des guides et des kits de sensibilisation Ã  disposition des Ã©tablissements scolaires. Toutes ces ressources sont disponibles sur une page spÃ©ciale, dÃ©diÃ©e Ã  la lutte contre lâ€™homophobie et la transphobie Ã  lâ€™Ã©cole. Au club sportif Quand on pratique un sport, on sait quâ€™il est important de se soutenir les uns les autres et de se faire confiance. La haine contre les LGBT nâ€™a pas sa place dans le milieu du sport. Le ministÃ¨re chargÃ© des Sports propose des ressources pour agir et mettre en place des actions de sensibilisation dans les clubs sportifs : aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls une rubrique internet spÃ©cialement dÃ©diÃ©e Ã  la prÃ©vention de la haine LGBT https://www.sports.gouv.fr/ethique-integrite/prevenir-les-dis criminations/lgbt-phobies/ aspirations contextes dumps-text itrameur Journal.md make_itrameur_corpus.sh programmes tableaux urls Une « boÃ®te Ã  outils » pour les clubs sportifs.
