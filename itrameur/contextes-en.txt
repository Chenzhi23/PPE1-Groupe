Second-wave feminism saw numerous clashes opposed to transgender women, since they were not seen as "true" women, and as invading women-only spaces.^[180]^[181] Though second-wave feminism argued for the sex and gender distinction, some feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female transition abandoned or devalued female identity and that transgender people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes.^[182] By the -- Transgender individuals experience significant rates of employment discrimination.

Transgender Population Size in the United States: a Meta-Regression of Population-Based Probability Samples -- Copyright [copyright] American Public Health Association 2017 See "The Health of the Transgender Community: Out, Proud, and Coming Into Their Own" in volume 107 on page 205. -- Background. Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. The population size of transgender individuals in the United States is not well-known, in part because official records, including the US Census, do not include data on gender identity. Population surveys today more often collect transgender-inclusive gender-identity data, and secular trends in culture and the media have created a somewhat more favorable environment for transgender people. Objectives. To estimate the current population size of transgender individuals in the United States and evaluate any trend over time. -- Selection criteria. We selected population-based surveys that used probability sampling and included self-reported transgender-identity data. -- pool eligible surveys and used meta-regression to address our hypothesis that the transgender population size estimate would increase over time. We used subsample and leave-one-out analysis to assess for -- Authors' conclusions. Future national surveys are likely to observe higher numbers of transgender people.

Estimates of the number of transgender adults significantly increased over the past decade, with a current best estimate of 390 per 100 000 adults. That is about 1 in -- more typical of younger adults than of the entire US population. We expect that future surveys will find higher numbers of transgender people and recommend that standardized questions be used, which will -- Meta-Regression Showing the Proportion of Transgender Adults Against Survey Year Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.^1 Research has shown that transgender individuals around the world and in the United States are exposed to -- sexual abuse.^2,3 Compared with the general population, a national survey conducted in the United States in 2008 found that transgender individuals were 4 times more likely to live in extreme poverty, had double the rate of unemployment, and had almost double the rate of being homeless.^4 In terms of health, transgender individuals had 4 times the rate of being HIV-infected and 28% postponed medical care -- understanding social determinants and health disparities faced by transgender people is the under- or nonrepresentation in a range of demographic and health-monitoring activities,^5 which may result from a lack of transgender-inclusive data collection with regard to gender identity. Accurate representation of the transgender population is complicated by the diversity within the community with regard to language and subcultures.^6,7 Moreover, the clinical literature has long conflated transgender identity with homosexuality.^8,9 Although a relationship between gender identity and sexual orientation may exist, the American Psychological Association (APA) recognizes that "Transgender people, like cis-gender people, may be sexually oriented toward men, women, both sexes, or neither sex. . . ."^10,11 Current best practice for collecting transgender-inclusive gender identity data is the 2-step method, which has been shown to optimize accurate identification of transgender people in a population.^12 This method records current gender identity as well as the sex assigned at birth; transgender people are those who identify as such and those whose current gender -- capture of people who identify with a binary gender (male or female), such as a transgender man who identifies only as male,^14 as well as others who may be considered transgender from a demographic perspective, even if they do not identify with the term "transgender," such as people who identify as genderqueer, agender, or having no -- whether the legal sex differs from the sex assigned at birth. As a result, at the most basic level, the population size of transgender individuals in the United States is not well-known. -- On the basis of a limited number of sources in 2009, the APA estimated the number of transgender individuals in the United States at 115 000 to 450 000, or 38 to 147 per 100 000 by using US Census data for that -- as the lower limit was based on members of a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Web site who identified as transgender, which is unlikely to be representative of the US general population, and the -- States. More recent US population-based surveys have reported transgender population sizes that are higher, ranging from 153 to 1647 per 100 000.^18 These estimates may not generalize to the United States -- that 0.6% of US adults, approximately 560 per 100 000, identify as transgender.^21 They used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is administered annually to randomly -- Because contemporary surveys more often collect transgender-inclusive gender-identity data, and secular trends in culture and the media have created a somewhat more favorable environment for transgender people, it is possible that the measured size of the transgender population has increased over time, rendering previous reports of population size even less applicable today. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the number of transgender individuals in the United States by performing a meta-analysis of population-based national surveys. A secondary aim was to evaluate for any trend over time. We hypothesized that the estimates of transgender population size would increase over time. Knowledge of the transgender population size can support the development of social policy that aims to protect transgender individuals against stigma and discrimination. From a health perspective, knowledge of the size of the transgender population can inform the development of health care programs to benefit transgender people, as well as inform insurance companies on how to best provide -- search was limited to 2006 to 2016, as older surveys are unlikely to contain transgender-inclusive gender-identity data.

We further excluded surveys that did not specifically report transgender identities (e.g., surveys that reported counts for "another gender" or counts for a response option that combined "transgender" and "other").

A majority of surveys (n = 13 or 65%) asked about being transgender in the context of gender identity, in accordance with current understanding that transgender is a gender identity that is different from a person's sex assigned at birth.^1 These surveys included the -- collection,^30-37 and the National Inmate Survey.^38-42 The remaining surveys (n = 7 or 35%) offered "transgender" as a response option in the context of sexual-orientation questions. These surveys included the 2013 NHIS,^43 the NATS,^29,44,45 and the NCHA before the 2009 wave of data collection.^46-48 Although transgender as sexual orientation does not reflect current understanding of transgender as a gender identity, and sexual orientation and gender identity are distinct phenomena,^8,11,14 we conducted separate meta-analyses for "transgender" collected as gender identity and "transgender" as sexual orientation for the sake of comparison. -- Questions that probed gender identity included "Do you consider yourself to be transgender?"; "Do you identify as transgender?"; "Are you male, female, or transgender?"; and "What is your gender?" In addition to male or female gender options, response options included "transgender"^31,38 and "male-to-female," "female-to-male," and "gender-nonconforming."^27 Sexual-orientation questions with transgender response options included "Which of the following best describes you?"; "Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?"; and "Do you consider yourself to be. . . ?" or "Do you think of yourself as. . .?" Response options included "transgender,"^45 "transgendered,"^46 and "You are transgender, transsexual, or gender variant."^29,43 Transgender Population Size The estimated proportion of transgender individuals based on surveys that categorized transgender as gender identity was 0.39% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16, 0.62; I^2 = 99.8%; k = 13).

A meta-regression model that included the year of -- Meta-Regression Showing the Proportion of Transgender Adults Against Survey Year, Based on Surveys That Categorized Transgender as Gender Identity: United States, 2007-2015 -- The estimated proportion of transgender individuals based on surveys that categorized transgender as sexual orientation was 0.06% (95% CI = 0.03, 0.09; I^2 = 96.6%; k = 7). It should be noted that presenting transgender in the context of sexual orientation does not reflect our current understanding of what it means to be transgender. We include these data for comparison only and doing so should not be taken as validation that presenting transgender as a sexual orientation is in any way appropriate. Leave-one-out analysis showed no disproportionate effect of single surveys. A direct comparison of estimates showed that the proportion for transgender categorized as sexual orientation was significantly lower than the overall proportion for transgender categorized as gender identity (0.06% vs 0.28%; t = 7.317; P &lt; .001, -- Our meta-regression of US population-based surveys indicated a substantial annual increase in the number of transgender adults in the United States.

We speculate that the observed annual increase is not an increase of the true population size, but the result of people feeling freer to report that they are or identify as transgender. This may result from societal changes, such as increased public visibility, awareness, and acceptance of transgender individuals.^49 The fact that US society is more aware of transgender issues is also reflected in public interest in the search term "transgender," which, according to Google Trends, has steadily increased since 2011. PubMed results for the number of publications found with the search term "transgender" show a similar phenomenon, with relatively small increases since 2005, but large -- differences in social acceptance affect the number of individuals who are willing to self-report a transgender identity.^50 This is why we based our analysis on US national samples only. Our estimate of 0.39% -- "Transgender" as a Label The label "transgender" is often used as an umbrella term, but does not fully capture the larger gender-nonconforming or gender-variant -- endorsed "gender-nonconforming." Other surveys that were not eligible for our analysis showed an even starker contrast between "transgender" and other nonbinary options. In a recent national nonprobability -- nonconforming" was about 1.5 times the number who endorsed "transgender."^53 In the 2013 and 2015 Minnesota College Student Health Survey, twice as many respondents endorsed "genderqueer" or "another gender" than "transgender."^54,55 -- example, 6th- to 12th-grade students in a national sample endorsed "genderqueer" more often than "transgender," and the number who endorsed "another gender" was almost half of those who endorsed "transgender."^15 In a national survey of LGBT individuals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, again, more endorsed "genderqueer" than "transgender," whereas the number who endorsed "androgynous" was slightly more than half of those who endorsed "transgender."^16 Also, not all transgender people identify with the term "transgender" (e.g., a transgender woman who identifies as female only).^14,56 As such, surveys that include "transgender" as the only option other than male or female are likely to underestimate the population size under the transgender umbrella. The available evidence suggests that the size of the gender-nonconforming or gender-variant population may be twice as large as our best estimate for the transgender population size. According to our analysis, surveys that considered transgender a sexual orientation resulted in at least a 4-fold underestimate of the number of transgender individuals. This underestimate should not come as a surprise, because transgender as sexual orientation does not reflect current understanding of transgender as gender identity.^11,14 It is striking, therefore, that national surveys such as the NHIS and NATS, and state surveys such as the Illinois and Idaho BRFSS,^57,58 until recent years, have categorized transgender as a sexual orientation rather than a gender identity. This practice misrepresents the number of transgender people in the United States and sustains misconceptions about what it means to be transgender. Of note, as of 2015, the NHIS no longer lists transgender as an option under sexual orientation. -- Several considerations should be made when one is interpreting the results of our study. First, transgender people differ greatly and not all transgender individuals desire or have the resources to seek surgeries, hormone therapy, or change their name or sex designation on legal documents.^1 We believe that our analysis based on self-reported data provides a more accurate estimate of the number of transgender individuals than estimates based on characteristics that represent subsamples of the transgender population only (e.g., only those who seek surgery). -- and university students), and research has shown that individuals aged 18 to 24 years are more likely to identify as transgender.^21 Also, the incarceration rate among transgender individuals is disproportionally high,^4 especially among transgender women, and as such they may be overrepresented in samples drawn from the inmate population, which -- from their current gender identity could be as large as our current estimate of the transgender population size. As such, our analysis may not have captured all individuals who are considered transgender from a demographic perspective, but who do not identify explicitly with the term "transgender." How the sum of these factors that may have affected our estimate ultimately add up is a complex question that perhaps can -- they are expected to be small, may have affected our estimate, especially because the base rate of the transgender population is small. -- respondent characteristics (e.g., general population, students, inmates) and the types of questions used to assess transgender identity.^59 For example, the 2015 wave of the NCHA asked about respondents' gender with 0.45% endorsing transgender, whereas respondents in the 2016 wave were asked whether they identified as transgender (1.8% responded yes). The small number of surveys in our analysis did not allow for testing more than 1 model predictor. -- We aimed to estimate the current transgender population size in the United States. On the basis of our analysis of national probability samples, 390 per 100 000 adults are estimated to be transgender in 2016, but the evidence suggests that future surveys will likely observe higher numbers. Our analysis also found that surveys use a variety of questions to ask about transgender identity and may still miscategorize transgender as a sexual orientation. This categorization does not reflect current understanding of transgender as a gender identity, and we recommend using standardized questions to identify respondents with transgender and nonbinary gender identities in future population surveys. Best practices regarding questions that can be used for transgender-inclusive data collection have already been published.^13 -- 1. Coleman E, Bockting W, Botzer M et al.

Awareness and fear of potential victimization contribute to the many stresses that transgender people already face.

The TransPop survey found that 48 percent of transgender adults in the United States have been beaten, physically attacked, or sexually assaulted at least once since the age of 18^48‚Äîa rate 12 percentage points higher than that of cisgender heterosexual people. (see Figure 7) Nearly half of those transgender respondents experienced such violence three or more times.

According to the TransPop survey, 32 percent of transgender people report experiencing intimate partner violence,^50 a rate 7 percentage points higher than that of cisgender heterosexual people.

Efforts to address transgender health disparities therefore run the risk of leaving many behind if they do not center the effects of racism, misogyny, criminalization, ableism, and xenophobia on transgender people‚Äôs health. -- High rates of rejection from family members are a major contributor to poor health outcomes among transgender people.

Many transgender people report having a more strained or conflicted relationship with their parents -- with 22 percent), and many more report being bullied as a minor (46 percent^59 compared with 17 percent). According to the U.S. Transgender Survey, 8 percent of transgender individuals report being kicked out of their home for being transgender, and 10 percent report running away from home.^60 This contributes to the fact that 30 percent of transgender individuals have experienced homelessness at some point in their lifetime‚Äîa number that increases to 51 percent among Black transgender women.^61 Family rejection is also associated with both the misuse of drugs and alcohol and attempted suicide.^62 -- Broadly, transgender individuals encounter systemic and institutional discrimination and barriers to economic security.

Nearly one-third of transgender individuals report living in poverty‚Äîcompared with just 12 percent of the U.S. population^72‚Äîlimiting their capacity to afford rent or mortgage payments. A majority of states lack legal protections in housing based on gender identity,^73 and 23 percent of transgender individuals‚Äîincluding 49 percent of Black transgender individuals‚Äîhave reported experiencing some form of housing discrimination, including eviction and the denial of a home or apartment.^74 (see Figure 10) For example, CAP survey data show that 52 percent of transgender individuals reported that discrimination negatively affected their -- depression, anxiety, and suicide.^76 These effects are worsened due to the lack of safe shelter access. Among transgender individuals who have stayed in shelters, 70 percent have reported experiencing harassment, physical assault, or removal.^77 (see Figure 11) One in 4 transgender individuals experiencing homelessness report avoiding homeless shelters for fear of harassment, and an additional 6 percent have been denied access to shelter,^78 contributing to 63 percent of transgender people experiencing homelessness also being unsheltered.^79 Among unsheltered transgender populations, 60 percent are trimorbid, facing co-occurring physical, mental, and substance use disorders.^80 Unsheltered transgender people are more than seven times as likely to have police interactions and more than eight times as likely to be sent to jail or prison than transgender individuals who are sheltered. Those numbers increase among Black unsheltered transgender individuals.^81 -- Transgender individuals are much more likely than their cisgender counterparts both to have negative encounters with law enforcement and to face mental and physical health concerns due to incarceration. Data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey show that of respondents who had a police encounter in the year prior, 58 percent experienced some form of mistreatment, including 61 percent of Black respondents and 71 percent of Latino/a respondents.^82 Police often target transgender people in discretionary interactions. One study of Latina transgender women in Los Angeles found that 60 percent of those who had been stopped by the police had not violated any laws.^83 Most prominently, police often use the pretext that transgender individuals‚Äîparticularly transgender women, and especially transgender women of color‚Äîare sex workers to create grounds to accost or detain them.^84 This practice is -- arrest and evidence of prostitution. These policies are so often used to target transgender people that they are referred to as ‚Äúwalking while trans‚Äù laws.^85 Staggeringly, 22 percent of individuals from the U.S. Transgender Survey who were arrested believe that they were arrested as a result of their gender identity,^86 likely contributing to CAP survey data showing that 50 percent of transgender individuals report avoiding police to avoid experiencing discrimination, compared -- Higher rates of contact with the criminal legal system mean that transgender individuals are incarcerated at a rate two times that of cisgender individuals.^87 These rates are even higher among transgender people of color; for example, Black transgender women are incarcerated at a rate 10 times that of the cisgender population.

Even more barriers to identification changes exist for transgender people with criminal records, who already face unique risks associated with discrimination and law enforcement interactions.^96 CAP‚Äôs survey shows that 66 percent of transgender respondents reported discrimination having an impact on their ability to obtain accurate identification documents in the year prior to the survey, compared with 23 percent of cisgender LGB respondents. TransPop data show that 1 in 2 transgender respondents have no identification with their authentic name, and just 1 in 3 have any identification with their authentic pronouns. In practice, this may expose transgender people to harassment, violence, and administrative barriers when engaging with health care providers, -- identifications do not reflect their current name or gender, 25 percent of transgender people have been verbally harassed and 16 percent have been denied services or benefits.^97 Incongruence between -- The context of barriers to care for transgender people: Medical system hostility -- Hospitals, clinics, and doctors‚Äô offices should be safe environments where people are given the medical care they need. For many transgender people, this is not the case. Even when providers do not outright refuse to treat transgender people, they may verbally abuse or physically harm their transgender patients.^99 Refusal and abuse of transgender people of color is even more common.^100 For transgender people who use drugs, have disabilities, or experience mental illness, medical system involvement also carries the risk of -- Medical system hostility has led to a long-standing reliance by transgender communities on black markets and informal networks to obtain gender-affirming care‚Äîpractices that have resurfaced as the -- Supporting transgender people through the medical system can only be achieved with the trust of transgender patients.

And 20 percent of transgender respondents report having no place to go when sick or need advice about health,^110 compared with 10 percent of cisgender -- Discrimination also affects the ability to access services, as TransPop data show that 61 percent of transgender respondents report having a personal doctor or health care provider,^111 compared with 76 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. Transgender individuals are less likely to have access to reproductive health services,^112 and 37 -- Further damaging are the high rates at which health care providers mistreat and abuse transgender adults. Nearly 1 in 2 transgender individuals, including 68 percent of transgender people of color, reported experiencing mistreatment at the hands of a provider in the year prior to CAP‚Äôs survey, including care refusal as well as verbal or physical abuse.^114 (see Figure 13) Twenty-eight percent of transgender individuals reported postponing or not receiving necessary medical care in the year prior to CAP‚Äôs survey for fear of experiencing discrimination, including 22 percent of transgender people of color. (see Figure 14) Stigma and discrimination from health care providers has also been explicitly linked to increased levels of substance use among transgender individuals.^115 -- Existing barriers to accessing medically necessary gender-affirming care create additional obstacles. Forty-six percent of transgender individuals had a health insurer deny them gender-affirming care in the year prior to CAP‚Äôs survey.^116 Fifty-five percent of transgender individuals report needing to travel at least 10 miles in order to receive transition-related care,^117 which can make it inaccessible for many.
