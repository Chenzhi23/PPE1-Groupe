Creating Opportunities for Women to Grow: Lady Tee's Journey to Advocacy

   Lady Tee

   Lady Tee Thompson knows that when it comes to securing equal rights and
   opportunities for everyone -- regardless of their gender, race,
   physical abilities, or socioeconomic status -- progress does not come
   easy.

   She's worked with public institutions in her home state of Michigan to
   protect access to education for women and marginalized students. And
   she's taken on some of the most entrenched societal failures, from food
   insecurity to lack of economic opportunity, that are holding girls and
   women back around the world.

   She shares how her experiences as a disabled, marginalized, and
   minority woman entrepreneur have shaped and inspired her lifelong
   efforts to ensure women of all backgrounds have access to education and
   opportunity.

What first motivated you to become an advocate for girls and women?

   My first experience with advocacy was in 1989, when I was the student
   government president at Highland Park Community College. At the time it
   was the only HBCU (historically Black colleges and universities) in
   Michigan, and women made up a majority of the student body. Highland
   Park was a vital institution of higher education, offering underserved
   communities in the Detroit area opportunities to further their
   education and build careers, especially in the medical field; it was
   home to a top-graduating nursing program.

   Unfortunately, the school was experiencing financial and administrative
   challenges, and by the time I was serving on student government,
   Highland Park was on the brink of closure. So I worked directly with
   the Michigan Board of Education to keep the school open for as long as
   possible.

   It was intimidating to speak before a big institution like the Board of
   Education as a young student, but I was determined to keep the school
   open. If Highland Park had shut its doors then, the most marginalized
   students -- those who were low income or homeless, physically disabled,
   or lacked access to technology at home -- would have been the most
   severely affected.

   In the end, I managed to help keep Michigan's top-graduating two-year
   HBCU open for several more years. Sadly, the school ultimately closed,
   but I am proud that I was able to help more women and marginalized
   students change their socioeconomic trajectories in those final years.

   Being the voice of my community -- representing Highland Park Community
   College -- before a massive institution was a turning point for me. I
   realized that I could have a seat at the proverbial table. From that
   point on, I realized that I could help make a difference for those who
   were most at risk of being left behind. My passion for advancing
   equality -- especially gender equality -- grew from there.

   And just as important, it helped me to see that making a real
   difference means overcoming more than one obstacle. It takes
   persistence to knock down barrier after barrier to progress. Achieving
   a gender-equal world means repealing discriminatory laws and practices,
   educating, protecting, and promoting the rights of girls and women at
   every turn.

     "Achieving a gender-equal world means repealing discriminatory laws
     and practices, educating, protecting, and promoting the rights of
     girls and women at every turn."
     -Lady Tee Thompson

How did you find the courage and the confidence to represent students before
the state's Board of Education?

   I had a fantastic mentor: Congressman John Conyers Jr. He served in the
   U.S. House of Representatives for over half a century and remains the
   longest-serving African American member of the House. He taught me how
   to effectively advocate against a huge institution like the Michigan
   Board of Education, and he personally taught me about equality, equity,
   and inclusion.

   As a champion for justice and equality himself, Congressman Conyers
   helped me understand that we all have a civic duty to eliminate
   discrimination, even -- and especially -- if that means going up
   against institutions or harmful norms in our societies. That is how
   progress happens for all of us. That is how we can ensure equality for
   everyone, everywhere.

That's a valuable perspective, especially since progress on gender equality
has been slow, stagnant, and set back by recent crises. Where have you found
progress since your time at Highland Park?

   Over the past two decades, I've shifted from local to global advocacy
   with a focus on supporting women entrepreneurs around the world.

   I had a pivotal moment in 2015 after speaking at a women's empowerment
   conference in West Africa. Several of the women I met were leading
   farming cooperatives and shared that they not only lacked land rights,
   but they couldn't receive the training they needed to scale up their
   businesses -- just because they were women.

   Ninety days later, I launched an agricultural and entrepreneur training
   firm: AgroBiz.org. To date, we have mentored over 50,000 girls and
   women across the U.S. and 14 other countries. Our support takes a
   variety of forms, from bringing women farmers from Africa to the U.S.
   for learning tours to educational programming on everything from
   precision agriculture to launching and growing microenterprises.

   Economic empowerment and food security are two sides of the same coin,
   and both are essential to gender equality. In fact, according to the
   Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of hungry people in the
   world could fall by as much as 150 million if women farmers were
   guaranteed access to the same resources as men.

How has your engagement with the United Nations Association of the USA
(UNA-USA) contributed to your gender advocacy efforts?

   Joining UNA-USA was a natural fit. As the current co-Chair of the
   Women's Affinity Group, I'm empowered to directly discuss and challenge
   systemic gender inequalities and inequities. And as a Global Goals
   Ambassador, I've been able to continue advocating for the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) in new ways and places.
   Lady Tee speaks at a women's empowerment conference in West Africa.
   Through her advocacy efforts, Lady Tee Thompson is working to
   accelerate progress across the Sustainable Development Goals -- from
   quality education (SDG4) to gender equality (SDG5) to decent work and
   economic growth (SDG8). Photo: Lady Tee Thompson

   For example, I traveled to Kwara State in Nigeria in early 2023 where I
   visited a local company run by KAM Holdings that manufactures steel
   nails. The best part? It's an all-women workforce, and their
   manufacturing process produces zero steel waste. It's a great example
   of how progress on one SDG unlocks progress across the entire
   framework, in this case, from Gender Equality (SDG 5) to Decent Work
   and Economic Growth (SDG 8) to Sustainable Consumption and Production
   (SDG 12). Seeing how innovative they were in order to ensure zero steel
   manufacturing waste and align their work with the SDGs was encouraging.
   But it was their dedication to the economic empowerment of women in
   their community that rejuvenated my soul and reaffirmed my faith that
   equality everywhere is possible.

What does #EqualEverywhere mean to you?

   It means bringing a global, gender-specific lens to our laws, cultural
   norms, homes, workplaces, and communities. It means accounting for
   girls and women -- and especially marginalized women -- in everything
   we do, and everywhere we do it. It's the only way we can build truly
   inclusive communities and societies. And we'll be able to do it only if
   everyone is an advocate for gender equality.

Introduction

   Transgender and nonbinary people have gained visibility in the U.S. in
   recent years as celebrities from Laverne Cox to Caitlyn
   Jenner to Elliot Page have spoken openly about their gender
   transitions. On March 30, 2022, the White House issued a
   proclamation recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility, the first time
   a U.S. president has done so.

   More recently, singer and actor Janelle Monáe came out as nonbinary,
   while the U.S. State Department and Social Security Administration
   announced that Americans will be allowed to select "X" rather than
   "male" or "female" for their sex marker on their passport and Social
   Security applications.

   At the same time, several states have enacted or are considering
   legislation that would limit the rights of transgender and nonbinary
   people. These include bills requiring people to use public bathrooms
   that correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth, prohibiting
   trans athletes from competing on teams that match their gender
   identity, and restricting the availability of health care to trans
   youth seeking to medically transition.

   A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 1.6% of U.S. adults are
   transgender or nonbinary - that is, their gender is different from the
   sex they were assigned at birth. This includes people who describe
   themselves as a man, a woman or nonbinary, or who use terms such as
   gender fluid or agender to describe their gender. While relatively few
   U.S. adults are transgender, a growing share say they know someone who
   is (44% today vs. 37% in 2017). One-in-five say they know someone who
   doesn't identify as a man or woman.

   In order to better understand the experiences of transgender and
   nonbinary adults at a time when gender identity is at the center of
   many national debates, Pew Research Center conducted a series of focus
   groups with trans men, trans women and nonbinary adults on issues
   ranging from their gender journey, to how they navigate issues of
   gender in their day-to-day life, to what they see as the most pressing
   policy issues facing people who are trans or nonbinary. This is part of
   a larger study that includes a survey of the general public on their
   attitudes about gender identity and issues related to people who are
   transgender or nonbinary.
   Terminology
   (BUTTON)

   The terms transgender and trans are used interchangeably throughout
   this essay to refer to people whose gender is different from the sex
   they were assigned at birth. This includes, but is not limited to,
   transgender men (that is, men who were assigned female at birth) and
   transgender women (women who were assigned male at birth).

   Nonbinary adults are defined here as those who are neither a man nor a
   woman or who aren't strictly one or the other. While some nonbinary
   focus group participants sometimes use different terms to describe
   themselves, such as "gender queer," "gender fluid" or "genderless," all
   said the term "nonbinary" describes their gender in the screening
   questionnaire. Some, but not all, nonbinary participants also consider
   themselves to be transgender.

   References to gender transitions relate to the process through which
   trans and nonbinary people express their gender as different from
   social expectations associated with the sex they were assigned at
   birth. This may include social, legal and medical transitions. The
   social aspect of a gender transition may include going by a new name or
   using different pronouns, or expressing their gender through their
   dress, mannerisms, gender roles or other ways. The legal aspect may
   include legally changing their name or changing their sex or gender
   designation on legal documents or identification. Medical care may
   include treatments such as hormone therapy, laser hair removal and/or
   surgery.

   References to femme indicate feminine gender expression. This is often
   in contrast to "masc," meaning masculine gender expression.

   Cisgender is used to describe people whose gender matches the sex they
   were assigned at birth and who do not identify as transgender or
   nonbinary.

   Misgendering is defined as referring to or addressing a person in ways
   that do not align with their gender identity, including using incorrect
   pronouns, titles (such as "sir" or "ma'am"), and other terms (such as
   "son" or "daughter") that do not match their gender.

   References to dysphoria may include feelings of distress due to the
   mismatch of one's gender and sex assigned at birth, as well as
   a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which is sometimes a prerequisite for
   access to health care and medical transitions.

   The acronym LGBTQ+ refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer
   (or, in some cases, questioning), and other sexual orientations or
   gender identities that are not straight or cisgender, such as intersex,
   asexual or pansexual.
   How we did this
   (BUTTON)

   Pew Research Center conducted this research to better understand the
   experiences and views of transgender and nonbinary U.S. adults. Because
   transgender and nonbinary people make up only about 1.6% of the adult
   U.S. population, this is a difficult population to reach with a
   probability-based, nationally representative survey. As an alternative,
   we conducted a series of focus groups with trans and nonbinary adults
   covering a variety of topics related to the trans and nonbinary
   experience. This allows us to go more in-depth on some of these topics
   than a survey would typically allow, and to share these experiences in
   the participants' own words.

   For this project, we conducted six online focus groups, with a total of
   27 participants (four to five participants in each group), from March
   8-10, 2022. Participants were recruited by targeted email outreach
   among a panel of adults who had previously said on a survey that they
   were transgender or nonbinary, as well as via connections through
   professional networks and LGBTQ+ organizations, followed by a screening
   call. Candidates were eligible if they met the technology requirements
   to participate in an online focus group and if they either said they
   consider themselves to be transgender or if they said their gender was
   nonbinary or another identity other than man or woman (regardless of
   whether or not they also said they were transgender). For more details,
   see the Methodology.

   Participants who qualified were placed in groups as follows: one group
   of nonbinary adults only (with a nonbinary moderator); one group of
   trans women only (with a trans woman moderator); one group of trans men
   only (with a trans man moderator); and three groups with a mix of trans
   and nonbinary adults (with either a nonbinary moderator or a trans man
   moderator). All of the moderators had extensive experience facilitating
   groups, including with transgender and nonbinary participants.

   The participants were a mix of ages, races/ethnicities, and were from
   all corners of the country. For a detailed breakdown of the
   participants' demographic characteristics, see the Methodology.

   The findings are not statistically representative and cannot be
   extrapolated to wider populations.

   Some quotes have been lightly edited for clarity or to remove
   identifying details. In this essay, participants are identified as
   trans men, trans women, or nonbinary adults based on their answers to
   the screening questionnaire. These words don't necessarily encompass
   all of the ways in which participants described their gender.
   Participants' ages are grouped into the following categories:  late
   teens; early/mid/late 20s, 30s and 40s; and 50s and 60s (those ages 50
   to 69 were grouped into bigger "buckets" to better preserve their
   anonymity).

   These focus groups were not designed to be representative of the entire
   population of trans and nonbinary U.S. adults, but the participants'
   stories provide a glimpse into some of the experiences of people who
   are transgender and/or nonbinary. The groups included a total of 27
   transgender and nonbinary adults from around the U.S. and ranging in
   age from late teens to mid-60s. Most currently live in an urban area,
   but about half said they grew up in a suburb. The groups included a mix
   of White, Black, Hispanic, Asian and multiracial American participants.

Identity and the gender journey

   (Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)

   Most focus group participants said they knew from an early age - many
   as young as preschool or elementary school - that there was something
   different about them, even if they didn't have the words to describe
   what it was. Some described feeling like they didn't fit in with other
   children of their sex but didn't know exactly why. Others said they
   felt like they were in the wrong body.

   "I remember preschool, [where] the boys were playing on one side and
   the girls were playing on the other, and I just had a moment where I
   realized what side I was supposed to be on and what side people thought
   I was supposed to be on. ... Yeah, I always knew that I was male, since
   my earliest memories."
   - Trans man, late 30s

   "As a small child, like around kindergarten [or] first grade ... I just
   was [fascinated] by how some people were small girls, and some people
   were small boys, and it was on my mind constantly. And I started to
   feel very uncomfortable, just existing as a young girl."
   - Trans man, early 30s

   "I was 9 and I was at day camp and I was changing with all the other
   9-year-old girls ... and I remember looking at everybody's body around
   me and at my own body, and even though I was visually seeing the exact
   shapeless nine-year-old form, I literally thought to myself, `oh, maybe
   I was supposed to be a boy,' even though I know I wasn't seeing
   anything different. ... And I remember being so unbothered by the
   thought, like not a panic, not like, `oh man, I'm so different, like
   everybody here I'm so different and this is terrible,' I was like, `oh,
   maybe I was supposed to be a boy,' and for some reason that exact quote
   really stuck in my memory."
   - Nonbinary person, late 30s

   "Since I was little, I felt as though I was a man who, when they were
   passing out bodies, someone made a goof and I got a female body instead
   of the male body that I should have had. But I was forced by society,
   especially at that time growing up, to just make my peace with having a
   female body."
   - Nonbinary person, 50s

   "I've known ever since I was little. I'm not really sure the age, but I
   just always knew when I put on boy clothes, I just felt so
   uncomfortable."
   - Trans woman, late 30s

   "It was probably as early as I can remember that I wasn't like my
   brother or my father [and] not exactly like my girl cousins but I was
   something else, but I didn't know what it was."
   - Nonbinary person, 60s

   Many participants were well into adulthood before they found the words
   to describe their gender. For those focus group participants, the path
   to self-discovery varied. Some described meeting someone who was
   transgender and relating to their experience; others described learning
   about people who are trans or nonbinary in college classes or by doing
   their own research.

   "I read a Time magazine article ... called `Homosexuality in America'
   ... in 1969. ... Of course, we didn't have language like we do now or
   people were not willing to use it ... [but] it was kind of the first
   word that I had ever heard that resonated with me at all. So, I went to
   school and I took the magazine, we were doing show-and-tell, and I
   stood up in front of the class and said, `I am a homosexual.' So that
   began my journey to figure this stuff out."
   - Nonbinary person, 60s

   "It wasn't until maybe I was 20 or so when my friend started his
   transition where I was like, `Wow, that sounds very similar to the
   emotions and challenges I am going through with my own identity.' ...
   My whole life from a very young age I was confused, but I didn't really
   put a name on it until I was about 20."
   - Nonbinary person, late 20s

   "I knew about drag queens, but I didn't know what trans was until I got
   to college and was exposed to new things, and that was when I had a
   word for myself for the first time."
   - Trans man, early 40s

   "I thought that by figuring out that I was interested in women,
   identifying as lesbian, I thought [my anxiety and sadness] would
   dissipate in time, and that was me cracking the code. But then, when I
   got older, I left home for the first time. I started to meet other
   trans people in the world. That's when I started to become equipped
   with the vocabulary. The understanding that this is a concept, and this
   makes sense. And that's when I started to understand that I wasn't
   cisgender."
   - Trans man, early 30s

   "When I took a human sexuality class in undergrad and I started
   learning about gender and different sexualities and things like that, I
   was like, `oh my god. I feel seen.' So, that's where I learned about it
   for the first time and started understanding how I identify."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-20s

   Focus group participants used a wide range of words to describe how
   they see their gender. For many nonbinary participants, the term
   "nonbinary" is more of an umbrella term, but when it comes to how they
   describe themselves, they tend to use words like "gender queer" or
   "gender fluid." The word "queer" came up many times across different
   groups, often to describe anyone who is not straight or cisgender. Some
   trans men and women preferred just the terms "man" or "woman," while
   some identified strongly with the term "transgender." The graphic below
   shows just some of the words the participants used to describe their
   gender.

   The way nonbinary people conceptualize their gender varies. Some said
   they feel like they're both a man and a woman - and how much they feel
   like they are one or the other may change depending on the day or the
   circumstance. Others said they don't feel like they are either a man or
   a woman, or that they don't have a gender at all. Some, but not all,
   also identified with the term transgender.

   "I had days where I would go out and just play with the boys and be one
   of the boys, and then there would be times that I would play with the
   girls and be one of the girls. And then I just never really knew what I
   was. I just knew that I would go back and forth."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-20s

   "Growing up with more of a masculine side or a feminine side, I just
   never was a fan of the labelling in terms of, `oh, this is a bit too
   masculine, you don't wear jewelry, you don't wear makeup, oh you're not
   feminine enough.' ... I used to alternate just based on who I felt I
   was. So, on a certain day if I felt like wearing a dress, or a skirt
   versus on a different day, I felt like wearing what was considered
   men's pants. ... So, for me it's always been both."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-30s

   "I feel like my gender is so amorphous and hard to hold and describe
   even. It's been important to find words for it, to find the outlines of
   it, to see the shape of it, but it's not something that I think about
   as who I am, because I'm more than just that."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "What words would I use to describe me? Genderless, if gender wasn't a
   thing. ... I guess if pronouns didn't exist and you just called me [by
   my name]. That's what my gender is. ... And I do use nonbinary also,
   just because it feels easier, I guess."
   - Nonbinary person, late 20s

   Some participants said their gender is one of the most important parts
   of their identity, while others described it as one of many important
   parts or a small piece of how they see themselves. For some, the focus
   on gender can get tiring. Those who said gender isn't a central - or at
   least not the most central - part of their identity mentioned race,
   ethnicity, religion and socioeconomic class as important aspects that
   shape their identity and experiences.

   "It is tough because [gender] does affect every factor of your life. If
   you are doing medical transitioning then you have appointments, you
   have to pay for the appointments, you have to be working in a job that
   supports you to pay for those appointments. So, it is definitely
   integral, and it has a lot of branches. And it deals with how you act,
   how you relate to friends, you know, I am sure some of us can relate to
   having to come out multiple times in our lives. That is why sexuality
   and gender are very integral and I would definitely say I am proud of
   it. And I think being able to say that I am proud of it, and my gender,
   I guess is a very important part of my identity."
   - Nonbinary person, late 20s

   "Sometimes I get tired of thinking about my gender because I am
   actively [undergoing my medical transition]. So, it is a lot of things
   on my mind right now, constantly, and it sometimes gets very tiring. I
   just want to not have to think about it some days. So, I would say
   it's, it's probably in my top three [most important parts of my
   identity] - parent, Black, queer nonbinary."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-40s

   "I live in a town with a large queer and trans population and I don't
   have to think about my gender most of the time other than having to
   come out as trans. But I'm poor and that colors everything. It's not a
   chosen part of my identity but that part of my identity is a lot more
   influential than my gender."
   - Trans man, early 40s

   "My gender is very important to my identity because I feel that they go
   hand in hand. Now my identity is also broken down into other factors
   [like] character, personality and other stuff that make up the recipe
   for my identity. But my gender plays a big part of it. ... It is
   important because it's how I live my life every day. When I wake up in
   the morning, I do things as a woman."
   - Trans woman, mid-40s

   "I feel more strongly connected to my other identities outside of my
   gender, and I feel like parts of it's just a more universal thing, like
   there's a lot more people in my socioeconomic class and we have much
   more shared experiences."
   - Trans man, late 30s

   Some participants spoke about how their gender interacted with other
   aspects of their identity, such as their race, culture and
   religion. For some, being transgender or nonbinary can be at odds with
   other parts of their identity or background.

   "Culturally I'm Dominican and Puerto Rican, a little bit of the macho
   machismo culture, in my family, and even now, if I'm going to be a man,
   I've got to be a certain type of man. So, I cannot just be who I'm
   meant to be or who I want myself to be, the human being that I am." -
   Trans man, mid-30s

   "[Judaism] is a very binary religion. There is a lot of things like for
   men to do and a lot of things for women to do. ... So, it is hard for
   me now as a gender queer person, right, to connect on some levels with
   [my] religion ... I have just now been exposed to a bunch of trans
   Jewish spaces online which is amazing."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-40s

   "Just being Indian American, I identify and love aspects of my culture
   and ethnicity, and I find them amazing and I identify with that, but
   it's kind of separated. So, I identify with the culture, then I
   identify here in terms of gender and being who I am, but I kind of feel
   the necessity to separate the two, unfortunately."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-30s

   "I think it's really me being a Black woman or a Black man that can
   sometimes be difficult. And also, my ethnic background too. It's really
   rough for me with my family back home and things of that nature."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-20s

Navigating gender day-to-day

   (Getty Images)

   For some, deciding how open to be about their gender identity can be a
   constant calculation. Some participants reported that they choose
   whether or not to disclose that they are trans or nonbinary in a given
   situation based on how safe or comfortable they feel and whether it's
   necessary for other people to know. This also varies depending on
   whether the participant can easily pass as a cisgender man or woman
   (that is, they can blend in so that others assume them to be cisgender
   and don't recognize that they are trans or nonbinary).

   "It just depends on whether I feel like I have the energy to bring it
   up, or if it feels worth it to me like with doctors and stuff like
   that. I always bring it up with my therapists, my primary [care
   doctor], I feel like she would get it. I guess it does vary on the
   situation and my capacity level."
   - Nonbinary person, late 20s

   "I decide based on the person and based on the context, like if I feel
   comfortable enough to share that piece of myself with them, because I
   do have the privilege of being able to move through the world and be
   identified as cis[gender] if I want to. But then it is important to me
   - if you're important to me, then you will know who I am and how I
   identify. Otherwise, if I don't feel comfortable or safe then I might
   not."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "The expression of my gender doesn't vary. Who I let in to know that I
   was formerly female - or formerly perceived as female - is kind of on a
   need to know basis."
   - Trans man, 60s

   "It's important to me that people not see me as cis[gender], so I have
   to come out a lot when I'm around new people, and sometimes that's
   challenging. ... It's not information that comes out in a normal
   conversation. You have to force it and that's difficult sometimes."
   - Trans man, early 40s

   Work is one realm where many participants said they choose not to share
   that they are trans or nonbinary. In some cases, this is because they
   want to be recognized for their work rather than the fact that they are
   trans or nonbinary; in others, especially for nonbinary participants,
   they fear it will be perceived as unprofessional.

   "It's gotten a lot better recently, but I feel like when you're
   nonbinary and you use they/them pronouns, it's just seen as really
   unprofessional and has been for a lot of my life."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "Whether it's LinkedIn or profiles [that] have been updated, I've
   noticed people's resumes have their pronouns now. I don't go that far
   because I just feel like it's a professional environment, it's nobody's
   business."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-30s

   "I don't necessarily volunteer the information just to make it public;
   I want to be recognized for my character, my skill set, in my work in
   other ways."
   - Trans man, early 30s

   Some focus group participants said they don't mind answering questions
   about what it's like to be trans or nonbinary but were wary of being
   seen as the token trans or nonbinary person in their workplace or among
   acquaintances. Whether or not they are comfortable answering these
   types of questions sometimes depends on who's asking, why they want to
   know, and how personal the questions get.

   "I've talked to [my cousin about being trans] a lot because she has a
   daughter, and her daughter wants to transition. So, she always will
   come to me asking questions."
   - Trans woman, early 40s

   "It is tough being considered the only resource for these topics,
   right? In my job, I would hate to call myself the token nonbinary, but
   I was the first nonbinary person that they hired and they were like,
   `Oh, my gosh, let me ask you all the questions as you are obviously the
   authority on the subject.' And it is like, `No, that is a part of me,
   but there are so many other great resources.'"
   - Nonbinary person, late 20s

   "I don't want to be the token. I'm not going to be no spokesperson. If
   you have questions, I'm the first person you can ask. Absolutely. I
   don't mind discussing. Ask me some of the hardest questions, because if
   you ask somebody else you might get you know your clock cleaned. So,
   ask me now ... so you can be educated properly. Otherwise, I don't
   believe it's anybody's business."
   - Trans woman, early 40s

   Most nonbinary participants said they use "they/them" as their
   pronouns, but some prefer alternatives. These alternatives include a
   combination of gendered and gender-neutral pronouns (like she/they) or
   simply preferring that others use one's names rather than pronouns.

   "If I could, I would just say my name is my pronoun, which I do in some
   spaces, but it just is not like a larger view. It feels like I'd rather
   have less labor on me in that regard, so I just say they/them."
   - Nonbinary person, late 20s

   "For me personally, I don't get mad if someone calls me `he' because I
   see what they're looking at. They look and they see a guy. So, I don't
   get upset. I know a few people who do ... and they correct you. Me, I'm
   a little more fluid. So, that's how it works for me."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-30s

   "I use they/she pronouns and I put `they' first because that is what I
   think is most comfortable and it's what I want to draw people's
   attention to, because I'm 5 feet tall and 100 pounds so it's not like I
   scream masculine at first sight, so I like putting `they' first because
   otherwise people always default to `she.' But I have `she' in there,
   and I don't know if I'd have `she' in there if I had not had kids."
   - Nonbinary person, late 30s

   "Why is it so hard for people to think of me as nonbinary? I choose not
   to use only they/them pronouns because I do sometimes identify with
   `she.' But I'm like, `Do I need to use they/them pronouns to be
   respected as nonbinary?' Sometimes I feel like I should do that. But I
   don't want to feel like I should do anything. I just want to be myself
   and have that be accepted and respected."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "I have a lot of patience for people, but [once someone in public used]
   they/them pronouns and I thanked them and they were like, `Yeah, I just
   figure I'd do it when I don't know [someone's] pronouns.' And I'm like,
   `I love it, thank you.'"
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   Transgender and nonbinary participants find affirmation of their gender
   identity and support in various places. Many cited their friends,
   chosen families (and, less commonly, their relatives), therapists or
   other health care providers, religion, or LGBTQ+ spaces as sources of
   support.

   "I'm just not close with my family [of origin], but I have a huge
   chosen family that I love and that fully respects my identity."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "Before the pandemic I used to go out to bars a lot; there's a queer
   bar in my town and it was a really nice place just being friends with
   everybody who went and everybody who worked there, it felt really nice
   you know, and just hearing everybody use the right pronouns for me it
   just felt really good."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "I don't necessarily go to a lot of dedicated support groups, but I
   found that there's kind of a good amount of support in areas or groups
   or fandoms for things that have a large LGBT population within them.
   Like certain shows or video games, where it's just kind of a joke that
   all the gay people flock to this."
   - Trans woman, late teens

   "Being able to practice my religion in a location with a congregation
   that is just completely chill about it, or so far has been completely
   chill about it, has been really amazing."
   - Nonbinary person, late 30s

   Many participants shared specific moments they said were small in the
   grand scheme of things but made them feel accepted and
   affirmed. Examples included going on dates, gestures of acceptance by a
   friend or social group, or simply participating in everyday activities.

   "I went on a date with a really good-looking, handsome guy. And he
   didn't know that I was trans. But I told him, and we kept talking and
   hanging out. ... That's not the first time that I felt affirmed or felt
   like somebody is treating me as I present myself. But ... he made me
   feel wanted and beautiful."
   - Trans woman, late 30s

   "I play [on a men's rec league] hockey [team]. ... I joined the league
   like right when I first transitioned and I showed up and I was ...
   nervous with locker rooms and stuff, and they just accepted me as male
   right away."
   - Trans man, late 30s

   "I ended up going into a barbershop. ... The barber was very welcoming,
   and talked to me as if I was just a casual customer and there was
   something that clicked within that moment where, figuring out my gender
   identity, I just wanted to exist in the world to do these natural
   things like other boys and men would do. So, there was just something
   exciting about that. It wasn't a super macho masculine moment, ... he
   just made me feel like I blended in."
   - Trans man, early 30s

   Participants also talked about negative experiences, such as being
   misgendered, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, some
   shared instances where they were treated or addressed as a gender other
   than the gender that they identify as, such as people referring to them
   as "he" when they go by "she," or where they were deadnamed, meaning
   they were called by the name they had before they transitioned.

   "I get misgendered on the phone a lot and that's really annoying. And
   then, even after I correct them, they keep doing it, sometimes on
   purpose and sometimes I think they're just reading a script or
   something."
   - Trans man, late 30s

   "The times that I have been out, presenting femme, there is this very
   subconscious misgendering that people do and it can be very
   frustrating. [Once, at a restaurant,] I was dressed in makeup and nails
   and shoes and everything and still everyone was like, `Sir, what would
   you like?' ... Those little things - those microaggressions - they can
   really eat away at people."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-40s

   "People not calling me by the right name. My family is a big problem,
   they just won't call me by my name, you know? Except for my nephew, who
   is of the Millennial generation, so at least he gets it."
   - Nonbinary person, 60s

   "I'm constantly misgendered when I go out places. I accept this -
   because of the way I look, people are going to perceive me as a woman
   and it doesn't cause me huge dysphoria or anything, it's just nice that
   the company that I keep does use the right pronouns."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   Some participants also shared stories of discrimination, bias,
   humiliation, and even violence. These experiences ranged from
   employment discrimination to being outed (that is, someone else
   disclosing the fact that they are transgender or nonbinary without
   their permission) without their permission to physical attacks.

   "I was on a date with this girl and I had to use the bathroom ... and
   the janitor ... wouldn't let me use the men's room, and he kept
   refusing to let me use the men's room, so essentially, I ended up
   having to use the same bathroom as my date."
   - Trans man, late 30s

   "I've been denied employment due to my gender identity. I walked into a
   supermarket looking for jobs. ... And they flat out didn't let me
   apply. They didn't even let me apply."
   - Trans man, mid-30s

   "[In high school,] this group of guys said, `[name] is gay.' I ignored
   them but they literally threw me and tore my shirt from my back and
   pushed me to the ground and tried to strip me naked. And I had to fight
   for myself and use my bag to hit him in the face."
   - Trans woman, late 20s

   "I took a college course [after] I had my name changed legally and the
   instructor called me out in front of the class and called me a liar and
   outed me."
   - Trans man, late 30s

Seeking medical care for gender transitions

   (Getty Images)

   Many, but not all, participants said they have received medical care,
   such as surgery or hormone therapy, as part of their gender
   transition. For those who haven't undergone a medical transition, the
   reasons ranged from financial barriers to being nervous about medical
   procedures in general to simply not feeling that it was the right thing
   for them.

   "For me to really to live my truth and live my identity, I had to have
   the surgery, which is why I went through it. It doesn't mean [that
   others] have to, or that it will make you more or less of a woman
   because you have it. But for me to be comfortable, ... that was a big
   part of it. And so, that's why I felt I had to get it."
   - Trans woman, early 40s

   "I'm older and it's an operation. ... I'm just kind of scared, I guess.
   I've never had an operation. I mean, like any kind of operation. I've
   never been to the hospital or anything like that. So, it [is] just kind
   of scary. But I mean, I want to. I think about all the time. I guess
   have got to get the courage up to do it."
   - Trans woman, early 40s

   "I've decided that the dysphoria of a second puberty ... would just be
   too much for me and I'm gender fluid enough where I'm happy, I guess."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "I'm too old to change anything, I mean I am what I am. [laughs]"
   - Nonbinary person, 60s

   Many focus group participants who have sought medical treatment for
   their gender transition faced barriers, although some had positive
   experiences. For those who said there were barriers, the cost and the
   struggle to find sympathetic doctors were often cited as challenges.

   "I was flat out turned down by the primary care physician who had to
   give the go-ahead to give me a referral to an endocrinologist; I was
   just shut down. That was it, end of story." - Nonbinary person, 50s

   "I have not had surgery, because I can't access surgery. So unless I
   get breast cancer and have a double mastectomy, surgery is just not
   going to happen ... because my health insurance wouldn't cover
   something like that. ... It would be an out-of-pocket plastic surgery
   expense and I can't afford that at this time."
   - Nonbinary person, 50s

   "Why do I need the permission of a therapist to say, `This person's
   identity is valid,' before I can get the health care that I need to be
   me, that is vital for myself and for my way of life?"
   - Nonbinary person, mid-40s

   "[My doctor] is basically the first person that actually embraced me
   and made me accept [who I am]."
   - Trans woman, late 20s

   Many people who transitioned in previous decades described how access
   has gotten much easier in recent years. Some described relying on
   underground networks to learn which doctors would help them obtain
   medical care or where to obtain hormones illegally.

   "It was hard financially because I started so long ago, just didn't
   have access like that. Sometimes you have to try to go to Mexico or
   learn about someone in Mexico that was a pharmacist, I can remember
   that. That was a big thing, going through the border to Mexico, that
   was wild. So, it was just hard financially because they would charge so
   much for testosterone. And there was the whole bodybuilding community.
   If you were transitioning, you went to bodybuilders, and they would
   charge you five times what they got it [for], so it was kind of tough."
   - Trans man, early 40s

   "It was a lot harder to get a surgeon when I started transitioning;
   insurance was out of the question, there wasn't really a national
   discussion around trans people and their particular medical needs. So,
   it was challenging having to pay everything out of pocket at a young
   age."
   - Trans man, early 30s

   "I guess it was hard for me to access hormones initially just because
   you had to jump through so many hoops, get letters, and then you had to
   find a provider that was willing to write it. And now it's like people
   are getting it from their primary care doctor, which is great, but a
   very different experience than I had."
   - Trans man, early 40s

Connections with the broader LGBTQ+ community

   (Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images)

   The discussions also touched on whether the participants feel a
   connection with a broader lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and
   queer (LGBTQ+) community or with other people who are LGBTQ+. Views
   varied, with some saying they feel an immediate connection with other
   people who are LGBTQ+, even with those who aren't trans or nonbinary,
   and others saying they don't necessarily feel this way.

   "It's kind of a recurring joke where you can meet another LGBT person
   and it is like there is an immediate understanding, and you are
   basically talking and giving each other emotional support, like you
   have been friends for 10-plus years."
   - Trans woman, late teens

   "I don't think it's automatic friendship between queer people, there's
   like a kinship, but I don't think there's automatic friendship or
   anything. I think it's just normal, like, how normal people make
   friends, just based on common interests."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "I do think of myself as part of the LGBT [community] ... I use the
   resources that are put in place for these communities, whether that's
   different health care programs, support groups, they have the community
   centers. ... So, I do consider myself to be part of this community, and
   I'm able to hopefully take when needed, as well as give back."
   - Trans man, mid-30s

   "I feel like that's such an important part of being a part of the
   [LGBTQ+] alphabet soup community, that process of constantly learning
   and listening to each other and ... growing and developing language
   together ... I love that aspect of creating who we are together,
   learning and unlearning together, and I feel like that's a part of at
   least the queer community spaces that I want to be in. That's something
   that's core to me."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "I identify as queer. I feel like I'm a part of the LGBT community.
   That's more of a part of my identity than being trans. ... Before I
   came out as trans, I identified as a lesbian. That was also a big part
   of my identity. So, that may be too why I feel like I'm more part of
   the LGB community."
   - Trans man, early 40s

   While many trans and nonbinary participants said they felt accepted by
   others in the LGBTQ+ community, some participants described their
   gender identity as a barrier to full acceptance. There was a sense
   among some participants that cisgender people who are lesbian, gay or
   bisexual don't always accept people who are transgender or nonbinary.

   "I would really like to be included in the [LGBTQ+] community. But I
   have seen some people try to separate the T from LGB ... I've run into
   a few situations throughout my time navigating the [LGBTQ+] community
   where I've been perceived - and I just want to say that there's nothing
   wrong with this - I've been perceived as like a more feminine or gay
   man in a social setting, even though I'm heterosexual. ... But the
   minute that that person found out that I wasn't a gay man ... and that
   I was actually a transgender person, they became cold and just
   distancing themselves. And I've been in a lot of those types of
   circumstances where there's that divide between the rest of the
   community."
   - Trans man, early 30s

   "There are some lesbians who see trans men as being traitors to
   womanhood. Those are not people that I really identify with or want to
   be close to."
   - Trans man, early 40s

   "It's only in the past maybe dozen or so years, that an identity like
   gender fluid or gender queer was acceptable even within the LGBTQ+
   community. ... I tried to go to certain LGBTQ+ events as a trans man
   and, you know, I was not allowed in because I looked too female. The
   gay men would not allow me to participate."
   - Nonbinary person, 50s

   "Technically based on the letters [in the acronym LGBTQ+] I am part of
   that community, but I've felt discrimination, it's very heavily
   exclusive to people who are either gay or lesbian and I think that's
   true ... for queer or bisexual or asexual, intersex ... anybody who's
   not like exclusively hardcore gay or lesbian. It's very exclusive, like
   excluding to those people. ... I feel like the BTQ is a separate group
   of people.... So, I identify with the second half of the letters as a
   separate subset."
   - Trans man, late 30s

Policy and social change

   (Steve Ahlquist/Uprise RI)

   When asked to name the most important policy or political issues facing
   transgender and nonbinary people in the United States today, many
   participants named basic needs such as housing, employment, and health
   care. Others cited recent legislation or policies related to people who
   are transgender that have made national news.

   "Housing is a huge issue. Health care might be good in New York, it
   might be good in California, but ... it's not a national equality for
   trans folks. Health care is not equal across the states. Housing is not
   equal across the states. So, I think that the issues right now that
   we're all facing is health care and housing. That's the top, the most
   important things."
   - Trans woman, early 40s

   "Definitely education. I think that's very important ... Whether you
   identify as trans or not as a young child, it's good to understand and
   know the different things under the umbrella, the queer umbrella. And
   it is also just a respect thing. And also, the violence that happens
   against trans and nonbinary people. I feel like educating them very
   young, that kind of helps - well, it is going to help because once you
   understand what's going on and you see somebody that doesn't identify
   the same as you, you'll have that respect, or you'll have that
   understanding and you're less likely to be very violent towards them."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-20s

   "Employment is a big one. And I know that some areas, more metropolitan
   progressive-leaning areas, are really on top of this, but they're trans
   people everywhere that are still being discriminated against. I think
   it's a personal thing for me that goes back to my military service, but
   still, it's just unfortunate. It's an unfortunate reality."
   - Trans man, early 30s

   "I think just the strong intersectionality of trans people with mental
   health issues, or even physical health issues. ... So in that way,
   accessing good health care or having good mental health."
   - Trans man, late 30s

   "I honestly think that the situation in Texas is the most pressing
   political and policy situation because it is a direct attack on the
   trans community. ... And it is so insidious because it doesn't just
   target bathrooms. This is saying that if you provide medical care to
   trans youth it is tantamount to child abuse. And it is so enraging
   because it is a known proven fact that access to gender affirming
   medical care saves lives. It saves the lives of trans youth. And trans
   youth have the highest suicide rate in the country."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-40s

   Participants had different takes on what gets in the way of progress on
   issues facing transgender and nonbinary people. Some pointed to the
   lack of knowledge surrounding the history of these issues or not
   knowing someone who is transgender or nonbinary. Others mentioned
   misconceptions people might have about transgender and nonbinary people
   that influence their political and policy perspectives.

   "People who don't know trans people, honestly ... that's the only
   barrier I can understand because people fear what they don't know and
   then react to it a lot of the time."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "Sometimes even if they know someone, they still don't consider them to
   be a human being, they are an `other,' they are an `it,' they are a
   `not like me,' `not like my family,' person and so they are put into a
   place socially where they can be treated badly."
   - Nonbinary person, 50s

   "Just the ignorance and misinformation and this quick fake social media
   fodder, where it encourages people who should not be part of the
   conversation to spread things that are not true."
   - Trans man, late 30s

   "Also, the political issues that face nonbinary people, it's that
   people think nonbinary is some made-up thing to feel cool. It's not to
   feel cool. And if someone does do it to feel cool, maybe they're just
   doing that because they don't feel comfortable within themselves."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-30s

   "There's so much fear around it, and misunderstanding, and people
   thinking that if you're talking to kids about gender and sexuality,
   that it's sexual. And it's like, we really need to break down that our
   bodies are not inherently sexual. We need to be able to talk with
   students and children about their bodies so that they can then feel
   empowered to understand themselves, advocate for themselves."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   When asked what makes them hopeful for the future for trans and
   nonbinary people, some participants pointed to the way things in
   society have already changed and progress that has been made. For
   example, some mentioned greater representation and visibility of
   transgender and nonbinary people in entertainment and other industries,
   while others focused on changing societal views as things that give
   them hope for the future.

   "I am hopeful about the future because I see so many of us coming out
   and being visible and representing and showing folks that we are not to
   stereotype."
   - Trans woman, early 40s

   "Also, even though celebrity is annoying, it's still cool when people
   like Willow [Smith] or Billie Eilish or all these popstars that the
   kids really love are like, `I'm nonbinary, I'm queer,' like a lot more
   progressive. ... Even just more visibility in TV shows and movies, the
   more and more that happens the more it's like, `Oh yeah, we are really
   here, you can't not see us.'"
   - Nonbinary person, late 20s

   "We shouldn't have to look to the entertainment industry for role
   models, we shouldn't have to, we should be able to look to our leaders,
   our political leaders, but I think, that's what gives me hope. Soon,
   it's going to become a nonissue, maybe in my lifetime."
   - Trans man, 60s

   "I have gotten a little bit into stand-up comedy in the last few weeks,
   and it is like the jokes that people made ten years ago are resurfacing
   online and people are enraged about it. They are saying like, `Oh, this
   is totally inappropriate.' But that comes with the recognition that
   things have changed, and language has changed, and people are becoming
   more intolerant of allowing these things to occur. So that is why I am
   hopeful, is being able to see that progression and hopeful continued
   improvement on that front."
   - Nonbinary person, late 20s

   "I think because of the shift of what's happening, how everything has
   become so normal, and people are being more open, and within the
   umbrella of queerness so many different things are happening, I think
   as we get more comfortable and we progress as a society, it's just
   going to be better. So, people don't have to hide who they are. So,
   that gives me hope."
   - Nonbinary person, mid-20s

   For many, young people are a source of hope. Several participants
   talked about younger generations being more accepting of those who are
   transgender or nonbinary and also being more accepted by their families
   if they themselves are trans or nonbinary.

   "And then the other portion that gives me hope are the kids, because I
   work now with so many kids who are coming out as trans earlier and
   their families are embracing them and everything. ... So I really am
   trusting in the young generation."
   - Nonbinary person, 60s

   "I mean kids don't judge you the same way as adults do about gender,
   and they're so expansive and have so much creativity. ... So it's just
   the kids, Gen Z, and it just makes me feel really, really hopeful."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "The youth, the youth. They understand almost intrinsically so much
   more about these things than I feel like my generation did. They give
   me so much hope for the future."
   - Nonbinary person, early 30s

   "I think future generations, just seeing this growing amount of support
   that they have, that it's just going to keep improving ... there's an
   increase in visibility but there's also an increase in support ... like
   resources for parents where they can see that they don't have to punish
   their kids. Their kids can grow up feeling like, `This is okay to be
   this way.' And I feel like that's not something that can be stopped."
   - Trans man, late 30s

Transgender

   Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff

   People whose gender identity or expression does not conform to the sex
   they were assigned at birth are transgender. While individuals may be
   assigned to a sex at birth based on how they present biologically,
   their sense of their gender may differ. A trans man is a man who was
   identified as female at birth, and a trans woman is a woman who was
   identified as male. (Transsexual is an older term that referred to
   trans individuals who sought or undertook intervention to change their
   bodies.)

   Many trans people, but not all, take steps, either through surgery,
   hormone treatments, or cosmetic or fashion decisions, to make their
   bodies and appearances align with their gender identities--the gender
   with which they identify--whether male-to-female or female-to-male.
   These steps, which also may include changing one's name and/or
   pronouns, are often referred to as transitioning, or as gender
   affirmation, although the term gender reassignment is used by some.
   (Cross-dressers, distinct from transgender individuals, generally
   identify with the gender label they receive at birth but often wear
   clothing associated with a different gender.)

   Gender has increasingly come to be recognized as existing on a
   continuum. Some people whose self-concept falls outside the traditional
   binary constructs of male and female, for example, identify as
   genderqueer. Others living outside of these binary constructs may
   identify as nonbinary, gender-nonconforming or third gender. These
   individuals may or may not also identify as transgender.

   The Transgender Experience

   Any person who identifies differently from the gender they were
   assigned at birth is transgender. There is no single source of
   transgender identity. Biological and genetic factors may play a role
   before a person is born, but personal experiences, in childhood,
   adolescence, or beyond, may also contribute to one's gender identity,
   or at least to one's awareness of it and comfort disclosing it.

   The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates that there
   are 1.4 million adults in the U.S. who identify as transgender,
   representing 0.7 percent of people between ages 18 and 24 and 0.5
   percent of those older than 65. Other experts believe the actual number
   of trans Americans may be closer to 2 million. The Williams Institute
   also estimates that 150,000 U.S. residents between ages 13 and 17 are
   transgender.
   What is gender dysphoria?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Beginning as early as childhood, a transgender person may have
   feelings of disconnection between their primary and secondary sex
   traits and designated gender and the gender with which they identify.
   People who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence,
   according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
   (DSM-5), may receive a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. It's a diagnosis
   that has been widely debated in the psychological and transgender
   communities because many see it as unnecessarily pathologizing of trans
   people, although getting a diagnosis can help some individuals access
   mental health care, and insurance coverage, they might otherwise not be
   able to take advantage of.

   While some children who experience such feelings do not go on to
   identify as transgender in adulthood, long-standing gender dysphoria is
   a common experience among adults who do identify as transgender.

   For more, see Gender Dysphoria.


   Does a person have to transition their gender to be transgender?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   No, but many do. Transitioning, or gender affirmation, is a complex
   process, one that begins not with medical procedures but with
   expressing one's identity, to themselves and to others with whom they
   feel safe. Reaching out to transgender community groups, or meeting
   with a mental health professional who provides affirmative care for
   transgender people are often among the first steps in the process.

   Different individuals follow different paths to gender affirmation:
   Some may change their name or pronouns, and/or change their clothing or
   appearance in nonmedical ways, while others will seek hormone therapy
   treatments and surgical procedures, often at significant expense, that
   modify their body to conform with their gender identity.
   Are trans people also homosexual?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   They may be. An individual's gender or gender identity does not
   determine their sexual orientation. Trans people, like any other
   individuals, may be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, or
   none of the above. Trans people commonly refer to their sexual
   orientation in terms of their gender identity: For example, a trans
   woman attracted to women would most likely consider herself to be a
   lesbian or gay woman.
   Do trans people date heterosexual nontrans partners?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   They can, but they often don't, in part because of persistent
   transphobia and resistance to such pairings among the heterosexual,
   cisgender population. For example, in one recent study, less than 3
   percent of heterosexual cisgender people said they would consider
   dating a trans individual, while 12 percent of nontransgender gay men,
   29 percent of nontransgender lesbians, and slightly more than half of
   people who identified as bisexual, queer, or nonbinary, reported that
   they would.
   Is being transgender a mental health disorder?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   No. Despite past misconceptions and persistent myths, being trans is
   not a mental health disorder. Mental health conditions by definition
   cause individuals significant distress or disability, while for trans
   people, affirmation of their identity is often a source of relief.
   However, many people struggling with expressing their gender identity,
   or facing discrimination, rejection, obstacles, or abuse because of it,
   may become depressed or anxious, or experience suicidal ideation. It is
   important that they seek out therapy or treatment from a mental health
   professional.
   What social and political challenges do trans people face?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Transgender awareness has grown in recent years, especially as more
   trans people have become prominent in pop culture and as more young
   people speak out about their identities at earlier ages than trans
   people in earlier generations may have. According to one survey, 62
   percent of adults in the U.S. now say they support trans rights, as
   opposed to 29 percent just five years earlier. Today, 30 percent of
   Americans say they personally know a trans person. But trans
   individuals still face significant social bias, stigma, abuse,
   violence, and legal discrimination, as well as a lingering perception
   based on outdated myths that they are mentally ill, socially deviant,
   or sexually predatory.

   Hate crimes have been frequently perpetuated against members of the
   transgender community. A majority of trans people report having
   experienced intimate partner violence, and nearly half report having
   been sexually assaulted, according to research by advocacy group Human
   Rights Campaign. Nearly 1 in 10 trans individuals report being
   physically assaulted each year, and dozens have been violently killed
   in the U.S. in recent years. Trans people are more likely to live in
   poverty and without health care than others, in part due to bias that
   limits their opportunities in the workforce. And trans individuals of
   racial or ethnic minority backgrounds generally report higher levels of
   discrimination of all kinds.

   In some states, legislatures have supported laws barring trans people
   from using public bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity
   or competing in athletic competition against those who share their
   gender identity. Many anti-discrimination statutes are not written, or
   have not been updated, to legally protect the civil rights of trans
   people, although more communities are passing laws or taking other
   legal actions to affirm the rights or trans individuals.
   How can I support trans individuals in my family, office, or community?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Use names and pronouns that fit their stated preference and gender. Do
   not make assumptions, such as about their sexual orientation or that
   they must be pursuing hormonal or surgical treatments. Learn about
   trans identity from books, organizations, or trusted websites, and ask
   questions of a friend or loved on with an open mind. If you are
   struggling with your own feelings about a partner, parent, child, or
   close friend expressing a different gender identity, don't feel ashamed
   or guilty about it, but do seek support from a mental health
   professional to help you take steps to maintain your strong
   relationship.

   The Lives of Transgender Youth

   For many adolescents and young adults, the journey to confidently
   declaring their gender identity and beginning to live as the gender
   that suits them ends in positivity, greater self-confidence, and higher
   self-esteem. But the path to that point often involves intense mental
   and emotional stress. Questioning one's own identity, and reckoning
   with the ramifications of the conclusions, can upend one's previous
   beliefs, and re-entering life as a different gender may lead to a loss
   of friendships and the jeopardizing of family connections, as well as
   bullying and discrimination, often violent, at school and in the
   community.

   Research suggests that as many as two-thirds of transgender adolescents
   have had suicidal thoughts, as compared to 13 percent of other teens.
   But the presence of supportive others in a young transgender person's
   life, especially parents, can make a significant difference: For
   example, 64 percent of transgender teens who felt supported by parents
   reported having high self-esteem, as opposed to just 13 percent of
   those who did not.
   How do people come to understand that they are transgender?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   People can become aware of their transgender identity at any age. Some
   become conscious of their identity as young children, and many who
   become aware of it in adolescence or adulthood can look back at early
   experiences of not feeling that they fit in with others from the gender
   to which they were assigned at birth.

   Many transgender individuals experience not just a sense of discomfort
   but intense dissatisfaction with their assigned sex or sexual
   characteristics, or the roles they are expected to play as presumed
   members of one gender or another. These feelings of gender dissonance
   can lead to depression and even suicidal ideation without an outlet to
   share them or support from family or friends. Some quickly and readily
   embrace their trans identity; others may not find such gender resonance
   until they encounter others who have had the same experience and with
   whom they can identify. But at any age, trans people may struggle with
   their identities, and may experience confusion, shame, or guilt,
   especially if their family, peer group, or community is not supportive
   of identities along the gender spectrum.
   How can a parent support a gender non-conforming child?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   By not rejecting them or dismissing their statements, but by being
   affirming and becoming their ally and advocate, in the family, in their
   school, and if necessary, in the broader community. Some children may
   appear to be gender non-conforming from an early age, and may
   experience distress or anxiety about their identity or the expectations
   placed on them because of what others assume to be their gender; their
   interactions with peers may be especially stressful.

   Parents should not assume, or insist, that these feelings merely
   represent a "phase," nor should they encourage or force a child to
   conform to a gender role that nay not fit their identity. Learning as
   much as they can about the trans experience, including reading about
   the experiences of other parents, can be helpful.
   How can a parent support a transitioning child?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   By standing with them through their disclosures, medical decisions, and
   appointments, and by taking everyday steps like using their child's
   chosen pronoun, or working with them to choose a new name.
   Transitioning at a young age may involve harrowing decisions which
   generally require parental consent, such as considering whether to take
   medication to block or delay puberty. Becoming informed about the
   ramifications of such medical decisions, and discussing them openly
   with a child and their doctor, can help to lessen a young person's
   anxiety.
   What is "rapid-onset" gender dysphoria?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   "Rapid-onset" gender dysphoria is a discredited term used by some to
   describe the apparent phenomenon of young people declaring themselves
   to be transgender all of a sudden, suggesting that these individuals
   have been influenced by social media, popular culture, or even peer
   pressure. The term has been used by some to explain the increased
   numbers of transgender youth in recent years, particularly in
   communities where the numbers seem to be unexpectedly high.

   However, the 2018 paper on which this theory is based has been widely
   debunked for, among other reasons, the fact that its survey
   participants were parents who already believed that their children had
   changed their gender identity with no previous warning. No actual trans
   youth were studied to formulate the paper's conclusions. While the
   theory has gained traction in some circles and continues to be used to
   question the sincerity of some transgender youth, the journal that
   published the paper has published a correction, stating, "Rapid-onset
   gender dysphoria is not a formal mental health diagnosis at this time.
   This report did not collect data from the adolescents and young adults
   (AYAs) or clinicians and therefore does not validate the phenomenon."

   Transgender people come from all walks of life, and HRC Foundation has
   estimated that there are more than 2 million of us across the United
   States. We are parents, siblings, and kids. We are your coworkers, your
   neighbors, and your friends. We are 7-year-old children and 70-year-old
   grandparents. We are a diverse community, representing all racial and
   ethnic backgrounds, as well as all faith traditions.

   Leer en Español

   The word "transgender" - or trans - is an umbrella term for people
   whose gender identity is different from the sex assigned to us at
   birth. Although the word "transgender" and our modern definition of it
   only came into use in the late 20th century, people who would fit under
   this definition have existed in every culture throughout recorded
   history.

   Alongside the increased visibility of trans celebrities like Laverne
   Cox, Jazz Jennings or the stars of the hit Netflix series "Pose," three
   out of every ten adults in the U.S. personally knows someone who is
   trans. As trans people become more visible, we aim to increase
   understanding of our community among our friends, families, and
   society.

What does it mean to be trans?

   The trans community is incredibly diverse. Some trans people identify
   as trans men or trans women, while others may describe themselves as
   non-binary, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, agender, bigender or
   other identities that reflect their personal experience. Some of us
   take hormones or have surgery as part of our transition, while others
   may change our pronouns or appearance. Roughly three-quarters of trans
   youth that responded to an HRC Foundation and University of Connecticut
   survey identified with terms other than strictly "boy" or "girl." This
   suggests that a larger portion of this generation's youth are
   identifying somewhere on the broad trans spectrum.

What challenges do trans people face?

   While trans people are increasingly visible in both popular culture and
   in daily life, we still face severe discrimination, stigma and systemic
   inequality. Some of the specific issues facing the trans community are:
     * Lack of legal protection- Trans people face a legal system that
       often does not protect us from discrimination based on our gender
       identity. Despite a recent U.S. Supreme Court Decision that makes
       it clear that trans people are legally protected from
       discrimination in the workplace, there is still no comprehensive
       federal non-discrimination law that includes gender identity -
       which means trans people may still lack recourse if we face
       discrimination when we're seeking housing or dining in a
       restaurant. Moreover, state legislatures across the country are
       debating - and in some cases passing - legislation specifically
       designed to prohibit trans people from accessing public bathrooms
       that correspond with our gender identity, or creating exemptions
       based on religious beliefs that would allow discrimination against
       LGBTQ+ people.
     * Poverty- Trans people live in poverty at elevated rates, and for
       trans people of color, these rates are even higher. Around 29% of
       trans adults live in poverty, as well 39% of Black trans adults,
       48% of Latine trans adults and 35% of Alaska Native, Asian, Native
       Americans and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander trans adults.
     * Stigma, Harassment and Discrimination - About half a decade ago,
       only one-quarter of people in the United States supported trans
       rights, and support increased to 62% by the year 2019. Despite this
       progress, the trans community still faces considerable stigma due
       to more than a century of being characterized as mentally ill,
       socially deviant and sexually predatory. While these intolerant
       views have faded in recent years for lesbians and gay men, trans
       people are often still ridiculed by a society that does not
       understand us. This stigma plays out in a variety of contexts -
       from lawmakers who leverage anti-trans stigma to score cheap
       political points; to family, friends or coworkers who reject trans
       people upon learning about our trans identities; and to people who
       harass, bully and commit serious violence against trans people.
       This includes stigma that prevents them from accessing necessary
       services for their survival and well-being. Only 30% of women's
       shelters are willing to house trans women. While recent legal
       progress has been made, 27% of trans people have been fired, not
       hired or denied a promotion due to their trans identity. Too often,
       harassment has led trans people to avoid exercising their most
       basic rights to vote. HRC Foundation's research shows that 49% of
       trans adults, and 55% of trans adults of color said they were
       unable to vote in at least one election in their life because of
       fear of or experiencing discrimination at the polls.
     * Violence Against Trans People- Trans people experience violence at
       rates far greater than the average person. Over a majority (54%) of
       trans people have experienced some form of intimate partner
       violence, 47% have been sexually assaulted in their lifetime and
       nearly one in ten were physically assaulted in between 2014 and
       2015. This type of violence can be fatal. At least 27 trans and
       gender non-conforming people have been violently killed in 2020
       thus far, the same number of fatalities observed in 2019.
     * Lack of Healthcare Coverage- An HRC Foundation analysis found that
       22% of trans people and 32% of trans people of color have no health
       insurance coverage. More than one-quarter (29%) of trans adults
       have been refused health care by a doctor or provider because of
       their gender identity. This sobering data reveals a healthcare
       system that fails to meet the needs of the trans community.
     * Identity Documents - The widespread lack of accurate identity
       documents among trans people can have an impact on every aspect of
       their lives, including access to emergency housing or other public
       services. Without identification, one cannot travel, register for
       school or access many services that are essential to function in
       society. Many states do not allow trans people to update their
       identification documents to match their gender identity. Others
       require evidence of medical transition - which can be prohibitively
       expensive and is not something that all trans people want - as well
       as fees for processing new identity documents, which may make them
       unaffordable for some members of the trans community.

   While advocates continue working to remedy these disparities, change
   cannot come too soon for trans people. Visibility - especially positive
   images of trans people in the media and society - continues to make a
   critical difference for us; but visibility is not enough and can come
   with real risks to our safety, especially for those of us who are part
   of other marginalized communities. That is why the Human Rights
   Campaign is committed to continuing to support and advocate for the
   trans community, so that the trans Americans who are and will become
   your friends, neighbors, coworkers and family members have an equal
   chance to succeed and thrive.

   ["I'm a transgender woman. That means my birth certificate said 'male,'
      but I always knew I was a girl. I was so relieved when I told my mom
       about how I felt - and instead of being mad, she was supportive." -
                                                                    Grace]

      ["Though my birth certificate said female, I have always felt like a
        boy. I kept it inside for many years, spending countless sleepless
      nights being terrified of what my family and friends would think and
    worrying about being rejected at school. I finally transitioned to the
               man I am today when I was 20 years old. Though I have faced
            discrimination by many people since then, I have also received
                 invaluable support. That is what keeps me going." - Alex]

   Understanding what it is like to be transgender can be hard, especially
   if you have never met a transgender person.

   Transgender is a broad term that can be used to describe people whose
   gender identity is different from the gender they were thought to be
   when they were born. "Trans" is often used as shorthand for
   transgender.

   To treat a transgender person with respect, you treat them according to
   their gender identity, not their sex at birth. So, someone who lives as
   a woman today is called a transgender woman and should be referred to
   as "she" and "her." A transgender man lives as a man today and should
   be referred to as "he" and "him."

   (Note: NCTE uses both the adjectives "male" and "female" and the nouns
   "man" and "woman" to refer to a person's gender identity.)

   Gender identity is your internal knowledge of your gender - for
   example, your knowledge that you're a man, a woman, or another gender.
   Gender expression is how a person presents their gender on the
   outside.That might include behavior, clothing, hairstyle, voice or body
   characteristics. Everyone has a gender identity, including cisgender -
   or non-transgender - people. If someone's gender identity matches the
   gender they were assigned at birth, then they are cisgender, or "cis"
   for short.

   Sex is often used in a medical or scientific contexts. Sex is a label
   -- male or female -- that you're assigned by a doctor at birth based on
   the appearance of the genitals you're born with. It doesn't define who
   you are, or what your gender identity might turn out to be.

   When a person begins to live according to their gender identity, rather
   than the gender they were thought to be when they were born, this time
   period is called gender transition. Deciding to transition can take a
   lot of reflection. Many transgender people risk social stigma,
   discrimination, and harassment when they tell other people who they
   really are. Despite those risks, being open about one's gender identity
   can be life-affirming and even life-saving.

   Possible steps in a gender transition may or may not include changing
   your clothing, appearance, name, or the pronoun people use to refer to
   you (like "she," "he," or "they"). If they can, some people change
   their identification documents, like their driver's license or
   passport, to better reflect their gender. And some people undergo
   hormone therapy or other medical procedures to change their physical
   characteristics and make their body match the gender they know
   themselves to be. All transgender people are entitled to the same
   dignity and respect, regardless of whether or not they have been able
   to take any legal or medical steps.

   Some transgender people identify as neither a man nor a woman, or as a
   combination of male and female, and may use terms like nonbinary or
   genderqueer to describe their gender identity. Those who are nonbinary
   often prefer to be referred to as "they" and "them."

   It is important to use respectful terminology, and treat transgender
   people as you would treat any other person. This includes using the
   name the person has asked you to call them (not their old name) as well
   as the pronouns they want you to use. If you aren't sure what pronouns
   a person uses, just ask politely.

Americans' Complex Views on Gender Identity and Transgender Issues

Most favor protecting trans people from discrimination, but
fewer support policies related to medical care for gender transitions; many
are uneasy with the pace of change on trans issues

   By Kim Parker, Juliana Menasce Horowitz and Anna Brown

Most favor protecting trans people from discrimination, but
fewer support policies related to medical care for gender transitions; many
are uneasy with the pace of change on trans issues

   How we did this
   (BUTTON)

   Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand
   Americans' views about gender identity and people who are transgender
   or nonbinary. These findings are part of a larger project that includes
   findings from six focus groups on the experiences and views of
   transgender and nonbinary adults and estimates of the share of U.S.
   adults who say their gender is different from the sex they were
   assigned at birth.

   This analysis is based on a survey of 10,188 U.S. adults. The data was
   collected as a part of a larger survey conducted May 16-22, 2022.
   Everyone who took part is a member of the Center's American Trends
   Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national,
   random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S.
   adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be
   representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity,
   partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about
   the ATP's methodology. See here to read more about the questions
   used for this report and the report's methodology.
   Terminology
   (BUTTON)

   References to White, Black and Asian adults include only those who are
   not Hispanic and identify as only one race. Hispanics are of any race.

   All references to party affiliation include those who lean toward that
   party. Republicans include those who identify as Republicans and those
   who say they lean toward the Republican Party. Democrats include those
   who identify as Democrats and those who say they lean toward the
   Democratic Party.

   References to college graduates or people with a college degree
   comprise those with a bachelor's degree or more. "Some college"
   includes those with an associate degree and those who attended college
   but did not obtain a degree.

   The terms "transgender" and "trans" are used interchangeably throughout
   this report to refer to people whose gender is different from the sex
   they were assigned at birth.
   A chart showing Most favor protecting trans people from discrimination,
   even as growing share say gender is determined by sex at birth

   As the United States addresses issues of transgender rights and the
   broader landscape around gender identity continues to shift, the
   American public holds a complex set of views around these issues,
   according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

   Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults say there is at least some
   discrimination against transgender people in our society, and a
   majority favor laws that would protect transgender individuals from
   discrimination in jobs, housing and public spaces. At the same time,
   60% say a person's gender is determined by their sex assigned at birth,
   up from 56% in 2021 and 54% in 2017.

   The public is divided over the extent to which our society has accepted
   people who are transgender: 38% say society has gone too far in
   accepting them, while a roughly equal share (36%) say society hasn't
   gone far enough. About one-in-four say things have been about right.
   Underscoring the public's ambivalence around these issues, even among
   those who see at least some discrimination against trans people, a
   majority (54%) say society has either gone too far or been about right
   in terms of acceptance.

   The fundamental belief about whether gender can differ from sex
   assigned at birth is closely aligned with opinions on transgender
   issues. Americans who say a person's gender can be different from their
   sex at birth are more likely than others to see discrimination against
   trans people and a lack of societal acceptance. They're also more
   likely to say that our society hasn't gone far enough in accepting
   people who are transgender. But even among those who say a person's
   gender is determined by their sex at birth, there is a diversity of
   viewpoints. Half of this group say they would favor laws that protect
   trans people from discrimination in certain realms of life. And about
   one-in-four say forms and online profiles should include options other
   than "male" or "female" for people who don't identify as either.

   Nonbinary U.S. adults
   Chart showing Young adults, Democrats more likely to say society hasn't
   gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender

   When it comes to issues surrounding gender identity, young adults are
   at the leading edge of change and acceptance. Half of adults ages 18 to
   29 say someone can be a man or a woman even if that differs from the
   sex they were assigned at birth. This compares with about four-in-ten
   of those ages 30 to 49 and about a third of those 50 and older. Adults
   younger than 30 are also more likely than older adults to say society
   hasn't gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender (47% vs.
   39% of 30- to 49-year-olds and 31% of those 50 and older)

   These views differ even more sharply by partisanship. Democrats and
   those who lean to the Democratic Party are more than four times as
   likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say that a person's
   gender can be different from the sex they were assigned at birth (61%
   vs. 13%). Democrats are also much more likely than Republicans to say
   our society hasn't gone far enough in accepting people who are
   transgender (59% vs. 10%). For their part, 66% of Republicans say
   society has gone too far in accepting people who are transgender.

   Amid a national conversation over these issues, many states are
   considering or have put in place laws or policies that would directly
   affect the lives of transgender and nonbinary people - that is, those
   who don't identify as a man or a woman. Some of these laws would limit
   protections for transgender and nonbinary people; others are aimed at
   safeguarding them. The survey finds that a majority of U.S. adults
   (64%) say they would favor laws that would protect transgender
   individuals from discrimination in jobs, housing and public spaces such
   as restaurants and stores. But there is also a fair amount of support
   for specific proposals that would limit how trans people can
   participate in certain activities and navigate their day-to-day lives.

   Roughly six-in-ten adults (58%) favor proposals that would require
   transgender athletes to compete on teams that match the sex they were
   assigned at birth (17% oppose this, 24% neither favor nor oppose).^1
   And 46% favor making it illegal for health care professionals to
   provide someone younger than 18 with medical care for a gender
   transition (31% oppose). The public is more evenly split when it comes
   to making it illegal for public school districts to teach about gender
   identity in elementary schools (41% favor and 38% oppose) and
   investigating parents for child abuse if they help someone younger than
   18 get medical care for a gender transition (37% favor and 36% oppose).
   Across the board, views on these policies are deeply divided by party.
   Views of laws and policies related to transgender issues differ widely
   by party

   When asked what has influenced their views on gender identity -
   specifically, whether they believe a person can be a different gender
   than the sex they were assigned at birth - those who believe gender can
   be different from sex at birth and those who do not point to different
   factors. For the former group, the most influential factors shaping
   their views are what they've learned from science (40% say this has
   influenced their views a great deal or a fair amount) and knowing
   someone who is transgender (38%). Some 46% of those who say gender is
   determined by sex at birth also point to what they've learned from
   science, but this group is far more likely than those who say a
   person's gender can be different from their sex at birth to say their
   religious beliefs have had at least a fair amount of influence on their
   opinion (41% vs. 9%).

   The nationally representative survey of 10,188 U.S. adults was
   conducted May 16-22, 2022. Previously published findings from the
   survey show that 1.6% of U.S. adults are trans or nonbinary, and the
   share is higher among adults younger than 30. More than four-in-ten
   U.S. adults know someone who is trans and 20% know someone who is
   nonbinary. Among the other key findings in this report:

   Nearly half of U.S. adults (47%) say it's extremely or very important
   to use a person's new name if they transition to a gender that is
   different from the sex they were assigned at birth and change their
   name. A smaller share (34%) say the same about using someone's new
   pronouns (such as "he" instead of "she"). A majority of Democrats (64%)
   - compared with 28% of Republicans - say it's at least very important
   to use someone's new name if they go through a gender transition and
   change their name. And while 51% of Democrats say it's extremely or
   very important to use someone's new pronouns, just 14% of Republicans
   say the same.

   Many Americans express discomfort with the pace of change around issues
   of gender identity. Some 43% say views on issues related to people who
   are transgender or nonbinary are changing too quickly, while 26% say
   things aren't changing quickly enough and 28% say the pace of change is
   about right. Adults ages 65 and older are the most likely to say views
   on these issues are changing too quickly; conversely, those younger
   than 30 are the most likely to say they're not changing quickly
   enough.

   More than four-in-ten (44%) say forms and online profiles that ask
   about a person's gender should include options other than "male" and
   "female" for people who don't identify as either. Some 38% say the same
   about government documents such as passports and driver's licenses.
   Half of adults younger than 30 say government documents that ask about
   a person's gender should provide more than two gender options, compared
   with about four-in-ten or fewer among those in older age groups. Views
   differ even more widely by party: While majorities of Democrats say
   forms and online profiles (64%) and government documents (58%) should
   offer options other than "male" and "female," about eight-in-ten
   Republicans say they should not (79% say this about forms and online
   profiles and 83% say this about government documents).

   Democrats and Republicans who agree that a person's gender is
   determined by their sex at birth often have different views on
   transgender issues. A majority (61%) of Democrats - but just 31% of
   Republicans - who say a person's gender is determined by the sex they
   were assigned at birth say there is at least a fair amount of
   discrimination against transgender people in our society today. And
   while 62% of Democrats who say gender is determined by sex at birth say
   they would favor policies that protect trans individuals against
   discrimination, fewer than half of their Republican counterparts say
   the same.

   Democrats' views on some transgender issues vary by age. Among
   Democrats younger than 30, about seven-in-ten (72%) say someone can be
   a man or a woman even if that's different from the sex they were
   assigned at birth, and 66% say society hasn't gone far enough in
   accepting people who are transgender. Smaller majorities of Democrats
   30 and older express these views. Age is less of a factor among
   Republicans. In fact, similar shares of Republicans ages 18 to 29 and
   those 65 and older say a person's gender is determined by their sex at
   birth (88% each) and that society has gone too far in accepting people
   who are transgender (67% of Republicans younger than 30 and 69% of
   those 65 and older).

   About three-in-ten parents of K-12 students (29%) say at least one of
   their children has learned about people who are transgender or
   nonbinary from a teacher or another adult at their school. Similar
   shares across regions and in urban, suburban and rural areas say their
   children have learned about this in school, as do similar shares of
   Republican and Democratic parents. Views on whether it's good or bad
   that their children have or haven't learned about people who are trans
   or nonbinary at school vary by party and by children's age. For
   example, among parents of children in elementary school, 45% say either
   that their children have learned about this and that's a bad thing or
   that they haven't learned about it and that's a good thing. A smaller
   share of parents of middle and high schoolers (34%) say the same.
   Republican parents are much more likely than Democratic parents to say
   this, regardless of their child's age.

A rising share say a person's gender is determined by their sex at birth

   Majority of U.S. adults say gender is determined by sex assigned at
   birth

   Six-in-ten U.S. adults say that whether a person is a man or a woman is
   determined by their sex assigned at birth. This is up from 56% one year
   ago and 54% in 2017. No single demographic group is driving this
   change, and patterns in who is more likely to say this are similar to
   what they were in past years.

   Today, half or more in all age groups say that gender is determined by
   sex assigned at birth, but this is a less common view among younger
   adults. Half of adults younger than 30 say this, lower than the 60% of
   30- to 49-year-olds who say the same. Even higher shares of those 50 to
   64 (66%) and those 65 and older (64%) say a person's gender is
   determined by their sex at birth.

   The party gap on this issue remains wide. The vast majority of
   Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP say gender is determined
   by sex assigned at birth (86%), compared with 38% of Democrats and
   Democratic leaners. Most Democrats say that whether a person is a man
   or a woman can be different from their sex at birth (61% vs. just 13%
   of Republicans). Liberal Democrats are particularly likely to hold this
   view - 79% say a person's gender can be different from sex at birth,
   compared with 45% of moderate or conservative Democrats. Meanwhile, 92%
   of conservative Republicans say gender is determined by sex at birth
   and 74% of moderate or liberal Republicans agree.

   Democrats ages 18 to 29 are also substantially more likely than older
   Democrats to say that someone's gender can be different from their sex
   assigned at birth, although majorities of Democrats across age groups
   share this view. About seven-in-ten Democrats younger than 30 say this
   (72%), compared with about six-in-ten or fewer in the older age groups.
   Among Republicans, there is no clear pattern by age. About eight-in-ten
   or more Republicans across age groups - including 88% each among those
   ages 18 to 29 and those 65 and older - say a person's gender is
   determined by their sex at birth.

   The view that a person's gender is determined by their sex assigned at
   birth is more common among those with lower levels of educational
   attainment and those living in rural areas or in the Midwest or South.
   This view is also more prevalent among men and Black Americans.

   A solid majority of those who do not know a transgender person say that
   whether a person is a man or a woman is determined by sex assigned at
   birth (68%), while those who do know a trans person are more evenly
   split. About half say gender is determined by sex assigned at birth
   (51%), while 48% say gender and sex assigned at birth can be
   different.

   Though Republicans who know a trans person are more likely than
   Republicans who don't to say gender can be different from sex assigned
   at birth, more than eight-in-ten in both groups (83% and 88%,
   respectively) say gender is determined by sex at birth. Meanwhile,
   there are large differences between Democrats who do and do not know a
   transgender person. A majority of Democrats who do know a trans person
   (72%) say someone can be a man or a woman even if that differs from
   their sex assigned at birth, while those who don't know anyone who is
   transgender are about evenly split (48% say gender is determined by sex
   assigned at birth while 51% say it can be different).

Many Americans point to science when asked what has influenced their views on
whether gender can differ from sex assigned at birth

   When asked about factors that have influenced their views about whether
   someone's gender can be different from the sex they were assigned at
   birth, 44% say what they've learned from science has had a great deal
   or a fair amount of influence. About three-in-ten (28%) point to their
   religious views and about two-in-ten (22%) say knowing someone who is
   transgender has influenced their views at least a fair amount. Smaller
   shares say what they've heard or read in the news (15%) or on social
   media (14%) has had a great deal or a fair amount of influence on their
   views.
   Chart showing More than four-in-ten U.S. adults say science has
   influenced their views of gender and sex at least a fair amount

   The factors people point to on this topic differ by whether or not they
   say gender is determined by sex at birth. Among those who say that
   whether someone is a man or a woman is determined by the sex they were
   assigned at birth, 46% say what they've learned from science has
   influenced their views on this at least a fair amount, while 41% say
   the same about their religious views. About one-in-ten point to what
   they've heard or read in the news (12%), what they've heard or read on
   social media (11%) or knowing someone who's transgender (11%).

   Among those who say someone can be a man or a woman even if that's
   different from the sex they were assigned at birth, 40% say their views
   on this topic have been influenced at least a fair amount by what
   they've learned from science. A similar share say the same about
   knowing a transgender person (38%). Smaller shares in this group say
   what they've heard or read in the news (19%) or on social media (18%)
   or their religious views (9%) have had a great deal or a fair amount of
   influence.

   Among those who say gender is determined by sex assigned at birth,
   adults younger than 30 stand out as being more likely than their older
   counterparts to say their knowledge of science (60%), what they've
   heard or read on social media (22%) or knowing someone who is trans
   (17%) influenced this view a great deal or a fair amount. In turn,
   those ages 65 and older tend to be more likely than younger age groups
   to cite their religious views (51% in the older group say this has had
   at least a fair amount of influence).

   Republicans who say gender is determined by sex assigned at birth are
   more likely than Democrats with the same view to say their knowledge of
   science (52% vs. 40%) and their religious views (45% vs. 34%) have had
   at least a fair amount of influence, while Democrats are more likely
   than Republicans to say the news (17% vs. 10%), social media (16% vs.
   10%) and knowing someone who is trans (15% vs. 9%) have influenced them
   - though the shares are still small among both groups.
   U.S. adults with different viewpoints on gender and sex say their
   opinions have been influenced by different factors

   On the flip side, among those who say someone's gender can
   be different from the sex they were assigned at birth, adults younger
   than 30 are also more likely than older adults to say social media has
   contributed to this view at least a fair amount (33% vs. 15% or fewer
   among older age groups). Adults ages 65 and older are more likely than
   their younger counterparts to say what they've learned from science has
   influenced their view (46% vs. 40% or fewer).

   Democrats who say whether someone is a man or a woman can be different
   from their sex at birth are more likely than Republicans with the same
   view to say that what they've learned from science (43% vs. 26%) and
   knowing someone who is transgender (40% vs. 26%) has influenced their
   view a great deal or a fair amount.

Public sees discrimination against trans people and limited acceptance

   Roughly eight-in-ten Americans say transgender people face at least
   some discrimination, and relatively few believe our society is
   extremely or very accepting of people who are trans. These views differ
   widely by partisanship and by beliefs about whether someone's gender
   can differ from the sex they were assigned at birth.

   Overall, 57% of adults say there is a great deal or a fair amount of
   discrimination against transgender people in our society today. An
   additional 21% say there is some discrimination against trans people,
   and 14% say there is a little or none at all.

   There are modest differences in views on this issue across demographic
   groups. Women (62%) are more likely than men (52%) to say there is a
   great deal or a fair amount of discrimination against transgender
   people, and college graduates (62%) are more likely than those with
   less education (55%) to say the same.
   Chart showing Most Americans say there is at least some discrimination
   against trans people in the U.S.

   There is, however, a wide partisan divide in these views: While 76% of
   Democrats and those who lean to the Democratic Party say there is a
   great deal or a fair amount of discrimination against trans people, 35%
   of Republicans and Republican leaners share that assessment.
   One-in-four Republicans see little or no discrimination against this
   group, compared with 5% of Democrats.

   These views are also linked with underlying opinions about whether a
   person's gender can be different from their sex assigned at birth.
   Among those who say someone can be a man or a woman even if that's
   different from the sex they were assigned at birth, 83% say there is a
   great deal or a fair amount of discrimination against trans people.
   Even so, some 42% of those who hold the alternative point of view -
   that gender is determined by sex assigned at birth - also see at least
   a fair amount of discrimination. Among Democrats who say gender is
   determined by sex at birth, that share rises to 61%.

   Relatively few adults (14%) say society is extremely or very accepting,
   while about a third (35%) say it is somewhat accepting. A plurality
   (44%) says our society is a little or not at all accepting of trans
   people.
   Chart showing Plurality of Americans say there is little or no societal
   acceptance of transgender people

   Again, these views are strongly linked with partisanship. Democrats
   have a much more negative view than Republicans, with 54% of Democrats
   saying society is a little accepting or not at all accepting of
   transgender people, compared with a third of Republicans.

   And, as with views of discrimination, assessments of societal
   acceptance are linked to underlying views about how gender is
   determined. Those who say one's gender can be different from the sex
   they were assigned at birth see less acceptance: 56% say society is a
   little accepting or not accepting at all of people who are transgender.
   This compares with 37% among those who say gender is determined by sex
   at birth. Republicans who say gender is determined by sex at birth are
   more likely than Democrats who say the same to believe that society is
   at least somewhat accepting of people who are transgender (61% vs.
   47%).

About four-in-ten say society has gone too far in accepting trans people

   While a majority of Americans see at least a fair amount of
   discrimination against transgender people and relatively few see
   widespread acceptance, 38% say our society has gone too far in
   accepting them. Some 36% say society has not gone far enough in
   accepting people who are trans, and 23% say the level of acceptance has
   been about right.

   These views differ along demographic and partisan lines. Young adults
   (ages 18 to 29) and those with a bachelor's degree or more education
   are among the most likely to say society hasn't gone far enough in
   accepting people who are trans. Men, White adults and those without a
   four-year college degree are among the most likely to say society has
   gone too far in this regard.
   Chart showing Public is divided over whether society has gone too far
   or not far enough in accepting transgender people

   There is a wide partisan divide as well. Roughly six-in-ten Democrats
   (59%) say society hasn't gone far enough in accepting people who are
   transgender, while 15% say it has gone too far (24% say it's been about
   right). Republicans' views are almost the inverse: 10% say society
   hasn't gone far enough and 66% say it's gone too far (22% say it's been
   about right).

   Even among those who see at least some discrimination against trans
   people, a majority (54%) say society has either gone too far in
   accepting trans people or been about right; 44% say society hasn't gone
   far enough.

Many say it's important to use someone's new name, pronouns when they've gone
through a gender transition

   Nearly half of adults say it's important to use someone's new name if
   they change their name as part of a gender transition

   Nearly half of adults (47%) say it's extremely or very important that
   if a person who transitions to a gender that's different from their sex
   assigned at birth changes their name, others refer to them by their new
   name. An additional 22% say this is somewhat important. Three-in-ten
   say this is a little or not at all important (18%) or that it shouldn't
   be done (12%).

   Smaller shares say that if a person transitions to a gender that's
   different from their sex assigned at birth and starts going by
   different pronouns (such as "she" instead of "he"), it's important that
   others refer to them by their new pronouns. About a third (34%) say
   this is extremely or very important, and 21% say this is somewhat
   important. More than four-in-ten say this is a little or not at all
   important (26%) or it should not be done (18%).

   These views differ along many of the same dimensions as other topics
   asked about. While 80% of those who believe someone's gender can be
   different from their sex assigned at birth also say it's extremely or
   very important to use a person's new name when they've gone through a
   gender transition, 27% of those who think gender is determined by one's
   sex assigned at birth share this opinion. The pattern is similar when
   it comes to use of preferred pronouns.

   Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to say it's extremely
   or very important to refer to a person using their new name or
   pronouns. When it comes to pronouns, a majority of Republicans (55%),
   compared with only 17% of Democrats, say using someone's new pronouns
   when they've been through a gender transition is not at all important
   or should not be done.
   Chart showing People who know a trans person place more importance on
   using a person's new name, pronouns if they transition

   There are some demographic differences as well, with women more likely
   than men and those with a four-year college degree more likely than
   those with less education to say it's extremely or very important to
   use a person's new name or pronouns when referring to them.

   In addition, people who say they know someone who is trans are more
   likely than those who do not to say this is extremely or very
   important. Even so, substantial shares of those who don't know a trans
   person view this as important. For example, 39% of those who don't know
   someone who is transgender say it's extremely or very important to
   refer to a person who goes through a gender transition and changes
   their name by their new name.

Plurality of adults say views on gender identity issues are changing too
quickly

   Many Americans are not comfortable with the pace of change that's
   occurring around issues involving gender identity. Some 43% say views
   on issues related to people who are transgender and nonbinary are
   changing too quickly. About one-in-four (26%) say things are not
   changing quickly enough, and 28% say they are changing at about the
   right speed.

   Women (30%) are more likely than men (21%) to say views on these issues
   are not changing quickly enough, and adults younger than 30 are more
   likely than their older counterparts to say the same. Among those ages
   18 to 29, 37% say views on these issues are not changing quickly
   enough; this compares with 26% of those ages 30 to 49, 22% of those
   ages 50 to 64 and 19% of those 65 and older. At the same time, White
   adults (46%) are more likely than Black (34%), Hispanic (39%) or Asian
   (31%) adults to say views are changing too quickly.
   Chart showing More than four-in-ten Americans say societal views on
   gender identity are changing too quickly

   Opinions also differ sharply by partisanship. Among Democrats, a
   plurality (42%) say views on issues involving transgender and nonbinary
   people are not changing fast enough, and 21% say they are changing too
   quickly. About a third (35%) say the speed is about right. By contrast,
   70% of Republicans say views on these issues are changing too quickly,
   while only 7% say views aren't changing fast enough. About one-in-five
   Republicans (21%) say they're changing at about the right speed.

   Respondents were asked in an open-ended format why they think views are
   changing too quickly or not quickly enough, when it comes to issues
   surrounding transgender and nonbinary people. For those who say things
   are changing too quickly, responses fell into several different
   categories. Some indicated that new ways of thinking about gender were
   inconsistent with their religious beliefs. Others expressed concern
   that the long-term consequences of medical gender transitions are not
   well-known, or that changing views on gender identity are merely a fad
   that's being pushed by the media. Still others said they worry that
   there's too much discussion of these issues in schools these days.

   For those who say views are not changing quickly enough, some pointed
   to discrimination and a lack of acceptance of trans and nonbinary
   people. Others pointed to legislative initiatives in some states aimed
   at restricting the rights of trans and nonbinary people. Many also said
   that too many people in our society aren't open to change when it comes
   to these issues.^2

In their own words: Why do some people think views on issues related to
transgender people and those who don't identify as a man or a woman are
changing too quickly?

   General concerns about the pace of change

   "The issue is so new to me I can't keep up. I don't know what to think
   about all of this new information. I'm baffled by so many changes."

   "It takes quite a bit of time for society to accept changes. I have not
   been aware of this issue for very long. I am relatively conservative
   and feel that changes need time to be accepted."

   Religious reasons

   "People now believe everyone should just forget about their birth
   identity and just go along with what they think they are. God made us
   all for a reason and if He intended us to pick our gender then there
   would be no reason to be born with specific male or female parts."

   "I have a personal religious belief that sex is an essential part of
   our eternal identity and that identifying as something other than you
   are ... just doesn't make a lot of sense."

   "I believe GOD created a man and a woman. We have overstepped our
   bounds in messing with the miracle of life. I side with my creator."

   Concerns about long-term medical consequences

   "We do not know the long-term health problems of hormone therapy,
   especially in young children."

   "More time needs to pass to study mental, physical, emotional
   ramifications of medications & surgeries, especially when done before
   puberty and/or adulthood."

   "Accepting gender fluidity, especially for younger children, seems
   quick. Also, medical treatments related to gender for people under 18
   seems to be being accepted without longer term studies."

   It's a fad/Driven by the media

   "I respect people's views about themselves, and I will refer to them in
   the way they want to be referred to, but I believe it's become trendy
   because it's being pushed so much in culture, especially for children."

   "News media, social media and entertainment media companies are trying
   to change, and it seems they have been succeeding in changing public
   opinion on this issue for many people."

   "It is encouraging kids who are easily influenced to participate in the
   `in' fad when their brains are not fully developed."

   Concerns about schools

   "Elementary school students should not be subjected to instruction on
   sex identity, any questions the child asks should be referred to a
   parent."

   "I think that young people are exposed to these issues at too early an
   age. I believe that it is up to the parents, and I oppose schools that
   want to include it in the `curriculum.'"

   "It's being pushed on society and especially on younger children,
   confusing them all the more. This is not something that should be
   taught in schools."

In their own words: Why do some people think views on issues related to
transgender people and those who don't identify as a man or a woman are
changing too slowly?

   Discrimination

   "There is far too much discrimination, hate, and violence directed
   toward people who are brave enough to stand up for who they truly are.
   We, as a country and as a society, need to respect how people want to
   identify themselves and be kind toward one another, end of story."

   "Protections for basic rights to self-determination in identity, health
   care choices, privacy, and consensual relationships should be a bare
   minimum that our society can provide for everyone - transgender people
   included."

   "There's too much discrimination. People need to quit controlling other
   people's private lives. I consider them very brave for having the
   courage to be who they identify with."

   "Equal protection has not kept up with trans issues, including trans
   youth and the right to gender-affirming care."

   Legislative efforts

   "Acceptance is not changing quick enough. There remains discrimination
   and elected officials are passing laws that make it more difficult for
   transgender individuals in society to live, work and exist."

   "We are going backwards with all the anti-gay & -trans legislation that
   is being passed."

   "For every step forward, it feels like there are two steps back with
   reactive conservative laws."

   "These laws are working to restrict the rights of trans and nonbinary
   people, and also discrimination is still very high which results in
   elevated rates of suicide, poverty, violence and homelessness
   especially for people of color."

   "The spate of laws being proposed that would take away the rights of
   transgender people is evidence that we're a long way from treating them
   right."

   Society is not open to change

   "Too many people are simply stuck in the binary. We, as a society, need
   to just accept that someone else's gender identity is whatever they say
   it is and it rarely has any bearing on the lives of others."

   "These are people. Who they say they are is all that matters. Society,
   mostly conservatives, doesn't understand change in any form. So, they
   fight it. And they hinder the ability for others to learn about
   themselves and others, which slows growing as a society to a crawl."

   "It's an issue that has been in the closet for centuries. It's time to
   acknowledge and accept that gender identity is a spectrum and not
   binary."

   "We are not accepting the changes. We refuse to see what is in front of
   us. We care too much about not changing the status quo as we know it."

   "Society often views this as a phase or a period of uncertainty in
   their life. Instead, it's about a person bringing their gender identity
   in line with what they have experienced internally all their life."

Most say they're not paying close attention to news about bills related to
transgender people

   Chart showing Liberal Democrats are more likely than other groups to be
   following news about bills related to trans people closely

   Many states are considering legislation related to people who are
   transgender, but a relatively small share of U.S. adults (8%) say
   they're following news about these bills extremely or very closely.
   Another 24% say they're following this somewhat closely, while about
   two-thirds say they're following it either a little closely (23%) or
   not all closely (44%).^3

   Only about one-in-ten or less across age, racial and ethnic groups, and
   across levels of educational attainment, say they are following news
   about bills related to people who are transgender extremely or very
   closely. Six-in-ten or more across demographic groups say they're
   following news about these bills a little closely or not closely at
   all.

   Liberal Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (46%) are more
   likely than moderate and conservative Democrats (29%) to say they are
   following news about state bills related to people who are transgender
   at least somewhat closely. Conservative Republicans and Republican
   leaners (31%) are more likely than their moderate and liberal
   counterparts (24%) - but less likely than liberal Democrats - to be
   following news about these bills at least somewhat closely. Still, half
   or more among each of these groups say they have been following news
   about this a little or not at all closely.

About six-in-ten would favor requiring that transgender athletes compete on
teams that match their sex at birth

   The survey asked respondents how they feel about some current laws and
   policies that are either in place or being considered across the U.S.
   related to transgender issues. Only two of seven items are either
   endorsed or rejected by a majority: 64% say they would favor policies
   that protect transgender individuals from discrimination in jobs,
   housing, and public spaces such as restaurants and stores, and 58% say
   they would favor policies that require that transgender athletes
   compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth rather
   than the gender they identify with.
   Chart showing Most Americans say they would favor laws that would
   protect transgender people from discrimination in jobs, housing and
   public spaces

   Even though there is not a majority consensus on most of these laws or
   policies, there are gaps of at least 10 percentage points on three
   items. Some 46% say they would favor making it illegal for health care
   professionals to provide someone younger than 18 with medical care for
   gender transitions, and 41% would favor requiring transgender
   individuals to use public bathrooms that match the sex they were
   assigned at birth rather than the gender they identify with; 31% say
   they would oppose each of these. Meanwhile, more say they
   would oppose (44%) than say they would favor (27%) requiring health
   insurance companies to cover medical care for gender transitions.

   Views are more divided when it comes to laws and policies that would
   make it illegal for public school districts to teach about gender
   identity in elementary schools (41% favor and 38% oppose) or that would
   investigate parents for child abuse if they helped someone younger than
   18 get medical care for a gender transition (37% favor and 36% oppose).
   Some 21% and 27%, respectively, say they'd neither favor nor oppose
   these policies.

Views on many policies related to transgender issues vary by age, party, and
race and ethnicity

   Majorities of U.S. adults across age groups express support for laws
   and policies that would protect transgender individuals from
   discrimination in jobs, housing, and public spaces such as restaurants
   and stores. About seven-in-ten adults ages 18 to 29 (70%) and 30 to 49
   (68%) say they favor such protections, as do about six-in-ten adults
   ages 50 to 64 (60%) and 65 and older (59%).

   But adults younger than 30 are more likely than those in each of the
   older age groups to say they favor laws or policies that would require
   health insurance companies to cover medical care for gender transitions
   (37% among those younger than 30 vs. about a quarter among each of the
   older age groups). They're also less likely than older adults to
   express support for bills and policies that would restrict the rights
   of people who are transgender or limit what schools teach about gender
   identity. On most items, those ages 50 to 64 and those 65 and older
   express similar views.
   Chart showing Views of laws and policies related to transgender issues
   differ by age

   Views differ even more widely along party lines. For example,
   eight-in-ten Democrats say they favor laws or policies that would
   protect trans individuals from discrimination, compared with 48% of
   Republicans. Conversely, by margins of about 40 percentage points or
   more, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to express support for
   laws or policies that would do each of the following: require trans
   athletes to compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at
   birth (85% of Republicans vs. 37% of Democrats favor); make it illegal
   for health care professionals to provide someone younger than 18 with
   medical care for a gender transition (72% vs. 26%); make it illegal for
   public school districts to teach about gender identity in elementary
   schools (69% vs. 18%); require transgender individuals to use public
   bathrooms that match the sex they were assigned at birth (67% vs. 20%);
   and investigate parents for child abuse if they help someone younger
   than 18 get medical care for a gender transition (59% vs. 17%).

   Overall, White adults tend to be more likely than Black, Hispanic and
   Asian adults to express support for laws and policies that would
   restrict the rights of transgender people or limit what schools can
   teach about gender identity. But among Democrats, White adults are
   often less likely than other groups to favor such laws and policies,
   particularly compared with their Black and Hispanic counterparts. And
   White Democrats are more likely than Black, Hispanic and Asian
   Democrats to say they favor protecting trans individuals from
   discrimination and requiring health insurance companies to cover
   medical care for gender transitions.

Sizable shares say forms and government documents should include options
other than `male' and `female'

   Chart showing About four-in-ten or more say forms and government
   documents should offer options other than `male' and `female'

   About four-in-ten Americans (38%) say government documents such as
   passports and driver's licenses that ask about a person's gender should
   include options other than "male" and "female" for people who don't
   identify as either; a larger share (44%) say the same about forms and
   online profiles that ask about a person's gender.

   Half of adults younger than 30 say government documents that ask about
   gender should include options other than "male" and "female," compared
   with 39% of those ages 30 to 49, 35% of those 50 to 64 and 33% of
   adults 65 and older. When it comes to forms and online profiles, 54% of
   adults younger than 30 and 47% of those ages 30 to 49 say these forms
   should include more than two gender options; smaller shares of adults
   ages 50 to 64 and 65 and older (37% each) say the same.

   Views on this vary considerably by party. A majority of Democrats and
   Democratic-leaning independents say forms and online profiles (64%) and
   government documents (58%) that ask about a person's gender should
   include options other than "male" and "female." In contrast, about
   eight-in-ten or more Republicans and Republican leaners say forms and
   online profiles (79%) and government documents (83%) should not include
   more than these two gender options.

   Those who say they know someone who is nonbinary are more likely than
   those who don't know anyone who's nonbinary to say forms and government
   documents should include gender options other than "male" and "female."
   Still, 39% of those who don't know anyone who's nonbinary say forms and
   online profiles shouldinclude other gender options, and 33% say the
   same about government documents that ask about a person's gender.
   Conversely, 31% of those who say they know someone who's nonbinary say
   forms and online profiles should not include options other than "male"
   and "female," and 41% say this about government documents.

About three-in-ten parents of K-12 students say their children have learned
about people who are trans or nonbinary at school

   In recent months, lawmakers in several states have introduced
   legislation that would prohibit or limit instruction on sexual
   orientation or gender identity in schools. The survey asked parents of
   K-12 students whether any of their children have learned about people
   who are transgender or who don't identify as a boy or a girl from a
   teacher or another adult at their school and how they feel about the
   fact that their children have or have not learned about this.

   Some 37% of parents with children in middle or high school say their
   middle or high schoolers have learned about people who are transgender
   or who don't identify as a boy or a girl from a teacher or another
   adult at their school; a much smaller share of parents of elementary
   school students (16%) say the same. Overall, 29% of parents with
   children in elementary, middle or high school say at least one of their
   K-12 children have learned about this at school.

   Similar shares of parents of K-12 students in urban (31%), suburban
   (27%) and rural (32%) areas - and in the Northeast (34%), Midwest
   (33%), South (26%) and West (28%) - say their school-age children have
   learned about people who are transgender or who don't identify as a boy
   or a girl. And Republican (27%) and Democratic (31%) parents are also
   about equally likely to say their children have learned about this in
   school. None of these differences are statistically significant.
   Chart showing Views on children learning about people who are trans or
   nonbinary at school differ by party, children's age

   Many parents of K-12 students don't think it's good for their children
   to learn about people who are transgender or nonbinary from their
   teachers or other adults at school. Among parents of elementary school
   students, 45% either say their children have learned about people who
   are trans or nonbinary at school and see this is a bad thing or say
   their children have not learned about this and say this is
   a good thing. A far smaller share (13%) say it's a good thing that
   their elementary school children have learned about people who are
   trans or nonbinary or that it's a bad thing that they haven't learned
   about this. And about four-in-ten (41%) say it's neither good nor bad
   that their elementary school children have or haven't learned about
   people who are transgender or nonbinary.

   Among parents with children in middle or high school, 34% say it's a
   bad thing that their children have learned about people who are trans
   or nonbinary at school or that it's a good thing that they haven't; 14%
   say it's good that their middle or high schoolers have learned about
   this or that it's bad that they haven't; and 51% say it's neither good
   nor bad that their children have or haven't learned about this in
   school.

   Republican and Republican-leaning parents with children in elementary,
   middle and high school are more likely than their Democratic and
   Democratic-leaning counterparts to say it's a bad thing that their
   children have learned about people who are trans or nonbinary at school
   or that it's a good thing that they haven't. In turn, Democratic
   parents are more likely to say it's good that their
   children have learned about this or bad that they haven't. They are
   also more likely to say it's neither good nor bad that their children
   have or haven't learned about people who are trans or nonbinary at
   school.

Transgender FAQ

   To learn more about how to be an ally to transgender people, check out
   GLAAD's Tips for Allies of Transgender People.
   What does transgender mean?

   Transgender is a term used to describe people whose gender identity
   differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Gender identity is a
   person's internal, personal sense of being a man or a woman (or boy or
   girl.) For some people, their gender identity does not fit neatly into
   those two choices. For transgender people, the sex they were assigned
   at birth and their own internal gender identity do not match.

   People in the transgender community may describe themselves using one
   (or more) of a wide variety of terms, including (but not limited to)
   transgender, transsexual, and non-binary. Always use the term used by
   the person.

   Trying to change a person's gender identity is no more successful than
   trying to change a person's sexual orientation -- it doesn't work. So
   most transgender people seek to bring their bodies into alignment with
   their gender identity. This is called transition.

   As part of the transition process, many transgender people are
   prescribed hormones by their doctors to change their bodies. Some
   undergo surgeries as well. But not all transgender people can or will
   take those steps, and it's important to know that being transgender is
   not dependent upon medical procedures.

   Transgender is an adjective and should never be used as a noun. For
   example, rather than saying "Max is a transgender," say "Max is a
   transgender person" or "Max is a transgender man." And transgender
   never needs an "-ed" at the end.
   How is sexual orientation different from gender identity?

   We use the acronym LGBTQ to describe the lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, transgender, queer community. The Q can also sometimes mean
   questioning.

   Sexual orientation describes a person's enduring physical, romantic,
   and/or emotional attraction to another person (for example: straight,
   gay, lesbian, bisexual), while gender identity describes a person's,
   internal, personal sense of being a man or a woman, or someone outside
   of the gender binary.

   Simply put: sexual orientation is about who you are attracted to and
   fall in love with; gender identity is about who you are.

   Like everyone else, transgender people have a sexual orientation.
   Transgender people may be straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer.
   For example, a person who transitions from male to female and is
   attracted solely to men would typically identify as a straight woman. A
   person who transitions from female to male and is attracted solely to
   men would typically identify as a gay man.
   What does non-binary mean, and is it different from being transgender?

   Everyone has a gender identity, an internal sense of self and
   perception of one's own gender. For some people their gender identity
   is the same as the sex they were assigned at birth (cisgender) and for
   some people their gender identity is different than the sex they were
   assigned at birth (transgender).
   There have always been transgender people who felt that their gender
   identity didn't fall neatly into the two binary categories of "man" or
   "woman." In the past, trans people who felt that way used the words
   genderqueer and genderfluid to describe that experience. While those
   words are still used today, it's now more common for people to call
   themselves non-binary if they feel their gender identity is something
   other than "man" or "woman." People who use the word non-binary to
   describe their gender identity typically also call themselves
   transgender.
   In recent years,  the word non-binary has seen a surge in popularity.
   As more people use the word non-binary to describe themselves, it has
   become its own umbrella term. Non-binary now means many different
   things to different people.
   Many of those people either explictly say something like, "I'm not
   transgender, I'm non-binary," implying those are two identities are
   unrelated, or they will simply never use the word transgender when
   describing themselves.
   Language is evolving in real time. But it's important to understand
   that there is no one right or wrong way to be non-binary, just like
   there is no right or wrong way to be transgender.
   The bottom line is: listen to how someone uses the word non-binary to
   describe themselves and try to understand how they are using it. Many
   of them will be telling you that they are a transgender person who is
   non-binary, while others will be using non-binary in a different way to
   describe their experience. Regardless, simply accept that they know
   best how to describe themselves.
   What name and pronoun do I use?

   For some transgender people, being associated with their birth name is
   a tremendous source of anxiety, or it is simply a part of their life
   they wish to leave behind. Respect the name a transgender person is
   currently using. If you happen to know a transgender person's birth
   name (the name given to them when they were born, but which they no
   longer use), don't share it without that person's explicit permission.
   Sharing a transgender person's birth name and/or photos of a
   transgender person before their transition is an invasion of privacy,
   unless they have given you permission to do so.

   If you're unsure which pronoun a person uses, listen first to the
   pronoun other people use when referring to that person. Someone who
   knows the person well will probably use the correct pronoun. If you
   must ask which pronoun the person uses, start with your own. For
   example, "Hi, I'm Alex and I use the pronouns he and him. What about
   you?" Then use that person's pronoun and encourage others to do the
   same. If you accidentally use the wrong pronoun for someone, apologize
   quickly and sincerely, then move forward with intention. The bigger
   deal you make out of the situation, the more uncomfortable it is for
   everyone.
   How do I treat a transgender person with respect?

   please see GLAAD's Media Reference Guide.
   Why is transgender equality important?

   Transgender people face staggering levels of poverty, discrimination,
   and violence. In 2016, 27 transgender people were killed. Since January
   1, 2017, eight transgender women of color have been murdered.

   According to the "2015 U.S. Trans Survey," a report by the National
   Center for Transgender Equality:
     * 29% of transgender people live in poverty, compared to 14% of the
       general population
     * 30% of transgender people report being homeless at some point in
       their lives, with 12% saying it was within the past 12 months
     * Transgender people experience unemployment at 3x the rate of the
       general population, with rates for people of color up to 4x the
       national unemployment rate
     * 30% of transgender people report being fired, denied a promotion,
       or experiencing mistreatment in the workplace due to their gender
       identity in the past 12 months
     * 31% of transgender people experienced mistreatment in the past year
       in a place of public accommodation, including 14% who were denied
       equal service, 24% who were verbally harassed, and 2% who were
       physically attacked because they were transgender
     * 40% of respondents reported attempting suicide in their lifetime,
       nearly nine times the attempted suicide rate in the United States
       (4.6%)

   Transgender people, particularly transgender women of color, face
   shockingly high rates of murder, homelessness, and incarceration. Most
   states and countries offer no legal protections in housing, employment,
   health care, and other areas where individuals experience
   discrimination based on their gender identity or expression.

Transgender Day of Remembrance

   Press Statement

   Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State

   November 20, 2023

   Each year on November 20, the world recognizes Transgender Day of
   Remembrance - a day to commemorate the transgender, non-binary, and
   gender non-conforming persons who are targeted and killed for living
   authentically and courageously.  Trans individuals are a part of every
   country, every culture, and every faith tradition.  The United States
   honors Transgender Day of Remembrance to affirm the humanity and human
   rights of transgender persons globally.

   Transgender persons experience disproportionately high levels of
   homicide and assault.  Their families and loved ones too often see no
   justice.  Countries around the world must ensure every hate crime is
   fully investigated.

   This year, we re-commit ourselves to ensuring acceptance and support
   for transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming persons.  It is
   everyone's responsibility to ensure trans persons can live full lives
   of dignity, without fear of violence or harm.  Until then, we will
   continue to speak loudly and clearly to end transphobic violence and
   homicide.

   A transgender person (often shortened to trans) is someone whose gender
   identity differs from that typically associated with the sex they were
   assigned at birth.^[1] Some transgender people who desire medical
   assistance to transition from one sex to another identify as
   transsexual.^[2]^[3] Transgender, often shortened as trans, is also an
   umbrella term; in addition to including people whose gender identity is
   the opposite of their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may
   also include people who are non-binary or genderqueer.^[4]^[5]^[6]
   Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a
   third gender, or else conceptualize transgender people as a third
   gender.^[7]^[8] The term may also include cross-dressers or drag kings
   and drag queens in some contexts.^[9] The term transgender does not
   have a universally accepted definition, including among
   researchers.^[10] ^[11]

   Being transgender is distinct from sexual orientation, and transgender
   people may identify as heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay or
   lesbian), bisexual, asexual, or otherwise, or may decline to label
   their sexual orientation.^[12] The opposite of transgender is
   cisgender, which describes persons whose gender identity matches their
   assigned sex.^[13] Accurate statistics on the number of transgender
   people vary widely,^[14] in part due to different definitions of what
   constitutes being transgender.^[10] Some countries, such as Canada,
   collect census data on transgender people.^[15] Generally, fewer than
   1% of the worldwide population are transgender, with figures ranging
   from <0.1% to 0.6%.^[16]^[17]^[18]

   Many transgender people experience gender dysphoria, and some seek
   medical treatments such as hormone replacement therapy,
   gender-affirming surgery, or psychotherapy.^[19] Not all transgender
   people desire these treatments, and some cannot undergo them for
   financial or medical reasons.^[19]^[20]

   The legal status of transgender people varies by jurisdiction. Many
   transgender people experience transphobia, or violence or
   discrimination towards transgender people, in the workplace,^[21] in
   accessing public accommodations,^[22] and in healthcare.^[23] In many
   places, they are not legally protected from discrimination.^[24]
   Several cultural events are held to celebrate the awareness of
   transgender people, including Transgender Day of Remembrance and
   International Transgender Day of Visibility,^[25]^[26] and the
   transgender flag is a common transgender pride symbol.^[27]

Terminology

   Before the mid-20th century various terms were used within and beyond
   Western medical and psychological sciences to identify persons and
   identities labeled transsexual, and later transgender from mid-century
   onward.^[5]^[30] Imported from the German and ultimately modeled after
   German Transsexualismus (coined in 1923),^[31] the English term
   transsexual has enjoyed international acceptability, though transgender
   has been increasingly preferred over transsexual.^[32] The word
   transgender acquired its modern umbrella term meaning in the
   1990s.^[33]^[34]

  Transgender

   Psychiatrist John F. Oliven of Columbia University used the term
   transgenderism in his 1965 reference work Sexual Hygiene and
   Pathology,^[35]^[36]^[37] writing that the term which had previously
   been used, transsexualism, "is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism'
   is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary
   transvestism."^[38]^[39] The term transgender was then popularized with
   varying definitions by various transgender, transsexual, and
   transvestite people, including Virginia Prince,^[2] who used
   transgenderal^[40] in the December 1969 issue of Transvestia, a
   national magazine for cross-dressers she founded.^[41] By the mid-1970s
   both trans-gender and trans people were in use as umbrella terms,^[note
   1] while transgenderist and transgenderal were used to refer to people
   who wanted to live their lives as cross-gendered individuals without
   sex reassignment surgery (SRS).^[42] By 1976, transgenderist was
   abbreviated as TG in educational materials.^[43]^[verification needed]

   By 1984, the concept of a "transgender community" had developed, in
   which transgender was used as an umbrella term.^[44] In 1985, Richard
   Elkins established the "Trans-Gender Archive" at the University of
   Ulster.^[41] By 1992, the International Conference on Transgender Law
   and Employment Policy defined transgender as an expansive umbrella term
   including "transsexuals, transgenderists, cross dressers", and anyone
   transitioning.^[45] Leslie Feinberg's pamphlet, "Transgender
   Liberation: A Movement Whose Time has Come", circulated in 1992,
   identified transgender as a term to unify all forms of gender
   nonconformity; in this way transgender has become synonymous with
   queer.^[46] In 1994, gender theorist Susan Stryker defined transgender
   as encompassing "all identities or practices that cross over, cut
   across, move between, or otherwise queer socially constructed
   sex/gender boundaries", including, but not limited to, "transsexuality,
   heterosexual transvestism, gay drag, butch lesbianism, and such
   non-European identities as the Native American berdache or the Indian
   Hijra".^[47]

   Between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s, the primary terms used under
   the transgender umbrella were "female to male" (FtM) for men who
   transitioned from female to male, and "male to female" (MtF) for women
   who transitioned from male to female. These terms have been superseded
   by "trans man" and "trans woman", respectively.^[48] This shift in
   preference from terms highlighting biological sex ("transsexual",
   "FtM") to terms highlighting gender identity and expression
   ("transgender", "trans man") reflects a broader shift in the
   understanding of transgender people's sense of self and the increasing
   recognition of those who decline medical reassignment as part of the
   transgender community.^[48]

   Transgender can also refer specifically to a person whose gender
   identity is opposite (rather than different from) the sex the person
   had or was identified as having at birth.^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52]

   Transfeminine
   is a term for any person, binary or non-binary, who was assigned male
   at birth and has a predominantly feminine gender identity or
   presentation.^[53]

   Transmasculine refers to a person assigned female at birth who has a
   predominantly masculine gender identity or presentation.^[53]

   Transgendered is a common term in older literature. Many within the
   transgender community deprecate it on the basis that transgender is an
   adjective, not a verb.^[54] Organizations such as GLAAD and The
   Guardian also state that transgender should never be used as a noun
   (e.g., "Max is transgender" or "Max is a transgender man", not "Max is
   a transgender").^[5]^[55] "Transgender" is also a noun for the broader
   topic of transgender identity and experience.^[56]

   Although the term "transgenderism" was once considered acceptable, it
   has come to be viewed as offensive, according to GLAAD.^[57] In 2020
   the International Journal of Transgenderism changed its name to the
   International Journal of Transgender Health "to reflect a change toward
   more appropriate and acceptable use of language in our field."^[58]

   Health-practitioner manuals, professional journalistic style guides,
   and LGBT advocacy groups advise the adoption by others of the name and
   pronouns identified by the person in question, including present
   references to the transgender person's past.^[59]^[60]

   In contrast, people whose sense of personal identity corresponds to the
   sex and gender assigned to them at birth - that is, those who are
   neither transgender nor non-binary or genderqueer - are called
   cisgender.^[61]

  Transsexual

   See also: Transsexual § Terminology

   Inspired by Magnus Hirschfeld's 1923 term seelischer Transsexualismus,
   the term transsexual was introduced to English in 1949 by David Oliver
   Cauldwell^[note 2] and popularized by Harry Benjamin in 1966, around
   the same time transgender was coined and began to be popularized.^[2]
   Since the 1990s, transsexual has generally been used to refer to the
   subset of transgender people^[2]^[62]^[63] who desire to transition
   permanently to the gender with which they identify and who seek medical
   assistance (for example, sex reassignment surgery) with this.

   Distinctions between the terms transgender and transsexual are commonly
   based on distinctions between gender and sex.^[64]^[65] Transsexuality
   may be said to deal more with physical aspects of one's sex, while
   transgender considerations deal more with one's psychological gender
   disposition or predisposition, as well as the related social
   expectations that may accompany a given gender role.^[66] Many
   transgender people reject the term transsexual.^[3]^[67]^[5] Christine
   Jorgensen publicly rejected transsexual in 1979 and instead identified
   herself in newsprint as trans-gender, saying, "gender doesn't have to
   do with bed partners, it has to do with identity."^[68]^[69] Some have
   objected to the term transsexual on the basis that it describes a
   condition related to gender identity rather than
   sexuality.^[70]^[better source needed]^[note 3]^[failed verification]
   Some transsexual people object to being included in the transgender
   umbrella.^[71]^[72]^[73]

   In his 2007 book Imagining Transgender: An Ethnography of a Category,
   anthropologist David Valentine asserts that transgender was coined and
   used by activists to include many people who do not necessarily
   identify with the term and states that people who do not identify with
   the term transgender should not be included in the transgender
   spectrum.^[71] Leslie Feinberg likewise asserts that transgender is not
   a self-identifier (for some people) but a category imposed by observers
   to understand other people.^[72] According to the Transgender Health
   Program (THP) at Fenway Health in Boston, there are no
   universally-accepted definitions, and confusion is common because terms
   that were popular at the turn of the 21st century may have since been
   deemed offensive. The THP recommends that clinicians ask clients what
   terminology they prefer, and avoid the term transsexual unless they are
   sure that a client is comfortable with it.^[70]^[undue weight? -

   Harry Benjamin invented a classification system for transsexuals and
   transvestites, called the Sex Orientation Scale (SOS), in which he
   assigned transsexuals and transvestites to one of six categories based
   on their reasons for cross-dressing and the relative urgency of their
   need (if any) for sex reassignment surgery.^[74] Contemporary views on
   gender identity and classification differ markedly from Harry
   Benjamin's original opinions.^[75] Sexual orientation is no longer
   regarded as a criterion for diagnosis, or for distinction between
   transsexuality, transvestism and other forms of gender-variant behavior
   and expression. Benjamin's scale was designed for use with heterosexual
   trans women, and trans men's identities do not align with its
   categories.^[76]

  Sexual orientation

   Main article: Transgender sexuality

   Gender, gender identity, and being transgender are distinct concepts
   from sexual orientation.^[77] Sexual orientation is an individual's
   enduring pattern of attraction, or lack thereof, to others (being
   straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, etc.), whereas gender
   identity is a person's innate knowledge of their own gender (being a
   man, woman, non-binary, etc.).^[57] Transgender people can have any
   orientation, and generally use labels corresponding to their gender,
   rather than assigned sex at birth. For example, trans women who are
   exclusively attracted to other women commonly identify as lesbians, and
   trans men exclusively attracted to women would identify as
   straight.^[57] Many trans people describe their sexual orientation as
   queer, in addition to or instead of, other terms.^[78]^[79]^[80]

   For much of the 20th century, transgender identity was conflated with
   homosexuality and transvestism.^[81]^[82] In earlier academic
   literature, sexologists used the labels homosexual and heterosexual
   transsexual to categorize transgender individuals' sexual orientation
   based on their birth sex.^[83] Critics consider these terms
   "heterosexist",^[84] "archaic",^[85] and demeaning.^[86] Newer
   literature often uses terms such as attracted to men (androphilic),
   attracted to women (gynephilic), attracted to both (bisexual), or
   attracted to neither (asexual) to describe a person's sexual
   orientation without reference to their gender identity.^[87] Therapists
   are coming to understand the necessity of using terms with respect to
   their clients' gender identities and preferences.^[88]

   The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey reported that of the 27,715
   transgender and non-binary respondents, 21% said queer best described
   their sexual orientation, 18% said pansexual, 16% said gay, lesbian, or
   same-gender-loving, 15% said straight, 14% said bisexual, and 10% said
   asexual.^[79] A 2019 Canadian survey of 2,873 trans and non-binary
   people found that 51% described their sexual orientation as queer, 13%
   as asexual, 28% as bisexual, 13% as gay, 15% as lesbian, 31% as
   pansexual, 8% as straight or heterosexual, 4% as two-spirit, and 9% as
   unsure or questioning.^[80] A 2009 study in Spain found that 90% of
   trans women patients reported being androphilic and 94% of trans men
   patients reported being gynephilic.^[89]

Related identities and practices

  Non-binary identity

   Main articles: Non-binary gender and Androgyny

   Some non-binary (or genderqueer) people identify as transgender. These
   identities are not specifically male or female. They can be agender,
   androgynous, bigender, pangender, or genderfluid,^[90] and exist
   outside of cisnormativity.^[91]^[92] Bigender and androgynous are
   overlapping categories; bigender individuals may identify as moving
   between male and female roles (genderfluid) or as being both masculine
   and feminine simultaneously (androgynous), and androgynes may similarly
   identify as beyond gender or genderless (agender), between genders
   (intergender), moving across genders (genderfluid), or simultaneously
   exhibiting multiple genders (pangender).^[93] Non-binary gender
   identities are independent of sexual orientation.^[94]^[95]

  Transvestism and cross-dressing

   Main article: Transvestism

   A transvestite is a person who cross-dresses, or dresses in clothes
   typically associated with the gender opposite the one they were
   assigned at birth.^[96]^[97] The term transvestite is used as a synonym
   for the term cross-dresser,^[98]^[99] although cross-dresser is
   generally considered the preferred term.^[99]^[100] The term
   cross-dresser is not exactly defined in the relevant literature.
   Michael A. Gilbert, professor at the Department of Philosophy, York
   University, Toronto, offers this definition: "[A cross-dresser] is a
   person who has an apparent gender identification with one sex, and who
   has and certainly has been birth-designated as belonging to [that] sex,
   but who wears the clothing of the opposite sex because it is that of
   the opposite sex."^[101] This definition excludes people "who wear
   opposite sex clothing for other reasons", such as "those female
   impersonators who look upon dressing as solely connected to their
   livelihood, actors undertaking roles, individual males and females
   enjoying a masquerade, and so on. These individuals are cross dressing
   but are not cross dressers."^[102] Cross-dressers may not identify
   with, want to be, or adopt the behaviors or practices of the opposite
   gender and generally do not want to change their bodies medically or
   surgically. The majority of cross-dressers identify as
   heterosexual.^[103]

   The term transvestite and the associated outdated term transvestism are
   conceptually different from the term transvestic fetishism, as
   transvestic fetishist refers to those who intermittently use clothing
   of the opposite gender for fetishistic purposes.^[104]^[105] In medical
   terms, transvestic fetishism is differentiated from cross-dressing by
   use of the separate codes 302.3 in the Diagnostic and Statistical
   Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)^[105] and F65.1 in the
   ICD.^[104]^[needs update]

  Drag

   See also: Drag king, Drag queen, and Faux queen

   [220px-Victoria_Sin%2C_sandwich.jpg] A drag queen performer

   Drag is clothing and makeup worn on special occasions for performing or
   entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for
   other reasons.^[106] Drag performance includes overall presentation and
   behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical,
   comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of
   women by second-wave feminism. Drag artists have a long tradition in
   LGBT culture.

   Generally the term drag queen covers men doing female drag, drag king
   covers women doing male drag, and faux queen covers women doing female
   drag.^[11]^[107] Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders
   and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Drag performers are
   not inherently transgender. Some drag performers, transvestites, and
   people in the gay community have embraced the pornographically derived
   term tranny for drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or
   cross-dressing; this term is widely considered an offensive slur if
   applied to transgender people.

History

   Main articles: Transgender history and Third gender

   A precise history of the global occurrence of transgender people is
   difficult to assess because the modern concept of being transgender,
   and of gender in general in relation to transgender identity, did not
   develop until the mid-1900s. Historical depictions, records and
   understandings are inherently filtered through modern principles, and
   were largely viewed through a medical and (often outsider)
   anthropological lens until the late 1900s.^[108]^[109]

   Some historians consider the Roman emperor Elagabalus to have been
   transgender. Elagabalus was reported to have dressed in a feminine
   manner, preferred to be called "Lady" instead of "Lord" and may have
   even sought a primitive form of gender-affirming
   surgery.^[110]^[111]^[112]^[113]^[114]^[excessive citations]

   Worldwide, a number of societies have had traditional third gender
   roles, some of which continue in some form into the present
   day.^[115]The Hippocratic Corpus (interpreting the writing of
   Herodotus) describes the "disease of the Scythians" (regarding the
   Enaree), which it attributes to impotency due to riding on a horse
   without stirrups. This reference was well discussed by medical writings
   of the 1500s-1700s. Pierre Petit writing in 1596 viewed the "Scythian
   disease" as natural variation, but by the 1700s writers viewed it as a
   "melancholy", or "hysterical" psychiatric disease. By the early 1800s,
   being transgender separate from Hippocrates' idea of it was claimed to
   be widely known, but remained poorly documented. Both trans women and
   trans men were cited in European insane asylums of the early 1800s. One
   of the earliest recorded transgender people in America was Thomas(ine)
   Hall, a seventeenth century colonial servant.^[116] The most complete
   account of the time came from the life of the Chevalier d'Éon
   (1728-1810), a French diplomat. As cross-dressing became more
   widespread in the late 1800s, discussion of transgender people
   increased greatly and writers attempted to explain the origins of being
   transgender. Much study came out of Germany, and was exported to other
   Western audiences. Cross-dressing was seen in a pragmatic light until
   the late 1800s; it had previously served a satirical or disguising
   purpose. But in the latter half of the 1800s, cross-dressing and being
   transgender became viewed as an increasing societal danger.^[108]

   William A. Hammond wrote an 1882 account of transgender Pueblo
   "shamans" [sic] (mujerados), comparing them to the Scythian disease.
   Other writers of the late 1700s and 1800s (including Hammond's
   associates in the American Neurological Association) had noted the
   widespread nature of transgender cultural practices among native
   peoples. Explanations varied, but authors generally did not ascribe
   native transgender practices to psychiatric causes, instead condemning
   the practices in a religious and moral sense. Native groups provided
   much study on the subject, and perhaps the majority of all study until
   after WWII.^[108]

   Critical studies first began to emerge in the late 1800s in Germany,
   with the works of Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfeld coined the term
   "transvestite" in 1910 as the scope of transgender study grew. His work
   would lead to the 1919 founding of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft
   in Berlin. Though Hirscheld's legacy is disputed, he revolutionized the
   field of study. The Institut was destroyed when the Nazis seized power
   in 1933, and its research was infamously burned in the May 1933 Nazi
   book burnings.^[117] Transgender issues went largely out of the public
   eye until after World War II. Even when they re-emerged, they reflected
   a forensic psychology approach, unlike the more sexological that had
   been employed in the lost German research.^[108]^[118]

Healthcare

   Main article: Transgender health care

   Further information: Gender transition

  Mental healthcare

   People who experience discord between their gender and the expectations
   of others or whose gender identity conflicts with their body may
   benefit by talking through their feelings in depth. While individuals
   may find counseling or psychotherapy helpful, it is no longer
   recommended as a prerequisite for further transition steps.^[119]
   Research on gender identity with regard to psychology, and scientific
   understanding of the phenomenon and its related issues, is relatively
   new.^[120]^[needs update?] The term gender incongruence is listed in
   the ICD by the WHO. In the American (DSM), the term gender dysphoria is
   listed under code F64.0 for adolescents and adults, and F64.2 for
   children.^[121]
   (Further information: Causes of gender incongruence.)

   France removed gender identity disorder as a diagnosis by decree in
   2010,^[122]^[123] but according to French trans rights organizations,
   beyond the impact of the announcement itself, nothing changed.^[124] In
   2017, the Danish parliament abolished the F64 Gender identity
   disorders. The DSM-5 refers to the topic as gender dysphoria (GD) while
   reinforcing the idea that being transgender is not considered a mental
   illness.^[125]

   Transgender people may meet the criteria for a diagnosis of gender
   dysphoria "only if [being transgender] causes distress or
   disability."^[126] This distress may manifest as depression or
   inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This
   diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that all transgender
   people suffer from GD, which has confused transgender people and those
   who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are
   comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing
   inner frustration or impairing their functioning do not suffer from GD.
   Moreover, GD is not necessarily permanent and is often resolved through
   therapy or transitioning. Feeling oppressed by the negative attitudes
   and behaviours of such others as legal entities does not indicate GD.
   GD does not imply an opinion of immorality; the psychological
   establishment holds that people with any kind of mental or emotional
   problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GD is whatever will
   alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this solution often, but
   not always, consists of undergoing a gender transition.^[120]

   Clinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to
   adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of
   practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this
   population of individuals.^[127] Many mental healthcare providers know
   little about transgender issues. Those who seek help from these
   professionals often educate the professional without receiving
   help.^[120] This solution usually is good for transsexual people but is
   not the solution for other transgender people, particularly non-binary
   people who lack an exclusively male or female identity. Instead,
   therapists can support their clients in whatever steps they choose to
   take to transition or can support their decision not to transition
   while also addressing their clients' sense of congruence between gender
   identity and appearance.^[128]

   Research on the specific problems faced by the transgender community in
   mental health has focused on diagnosis and clinicians' experiences
   instead of transgender clients' experiences.^[129] Therapy was not
   always sought by transgender people due to mental health needs. Prior
   to the seventh version of the Standards of Care (SOC), an individual
   had to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder in order to proceed
   with hormone treatments or sexual reassignment surgery. The new version
   decreased the focus on diagnosis and instead emphasized the importance
   of flexibility in order to meet the diverse health care needs of
   transsexual, transgender, and all gender-nonconforming people.^[130]

   The reasons for seeking mental health services vary according to the
   individual. A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily
   mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of
   dealing with stigma and experiencing transphobia pushes many
   transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life,
   as one trans woman reflected: "Transgendered individuals are going to
   come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do,
   specifically, with being transgendered. It has to do because they've
   had to hide, they've had to lie, and they've felt all of this guilt and
   shame, unfortunately usually for years!"^[129] Many transgender people
   also seek mental health treatment for depression and anxiety caused by
   the stigma attached to being transgender, and some transgender people
   have stressed the importance of acknowledging their gender identity
   with a therapist in order to discuss other quality-of-life
   issues.^[129] Rarely, some choose to detransition.^[131]

   Problems still remain surrounding misinformation about transgender
   issues that hurt transgender people's mental health experiences. One
   trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate
   program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training:
   "Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe
   that's it. I don't think I've had any formal training just going
   through [clinical] programs ... I don't think most [therapists] know.
   Most therapists - Master's degree, PhD level - they've had ... one
   diversity class on GLBT issues. One class out of the huge diversity
   training. One class. And it was probably mostly about gay
   lifestyle."^[129] Many health insurance policies do not cover treatment
   associated with gender transition, and numerous people are under- or
   uninsured, which raises concerns about the insufficient training most
   therapists receive prior to working with transgender clients,
   potentially increasing financial strain on clients without providing
   the treatment they need.^[129] Many clinicians who work with
   transgender clients only receive mediocre training on gender identity,
   but introductory training on interacting with transgender people has
   recently been made available to health care professionals to help
   remove barriers and increase the level of service for the transgender
   population.^[132] In February 2010, France became the first country in
   the world to remove transgender identity from the list of mental
   diseases.^[133]^[134]

   A 2014 study carried out by the Williams Institute (a UCLA think tank)
   found that 41% of transgender people had attempted suicide, with the
   rate being higher among people who experienced discrimination in access
   to housing or healthcare, harassment, physical or sexual assault, or
   rejection by family.^[135] A 2019 follow-up study found that
   transgender people who wanted and received gender-affirming medical
   care had substantially lower rates of suicidal thoughts and
   attempts.^[136] However, a study on the impact of parental support on
   trans youth found that among trans children with supportive parents,
   only 4% attempted suicide, a 93% decrease.^[137]

   Autism is more common in people who are gender dysphoric. It is not
   known whether there is a biological basis. This may be due to the fact
   that people on the autism spectrum are less concerned with societal
   disapproval, and feel less fear or inhibition about coming out as trans
   than others.^[138]^[better source needed]

  Physical healthcare

   Medical and surgical procedures exist for transsexual and some
   transgender people, though most categories of transgender people as
   described above are not known for seeking the following treatments.
   Hormone replacement therapy for trans men induces beard growth and
   masculinizes skin, hair, voice, and fat distribution. Hormone
   replacement therapy for trans women feminizes fat distribution and
   breasts, as well as diminishes muscle mass and strength. Laser hair
   removal or electrolysis removes excess hair for trans women. Surgical
   procedures for trans women feminize the voice, skin, face, Adam's
   apple, breasts, waist, buttocks, and genitals. Surgical procedures for
   trans men masculinize the chest and genitals and remove the womb,
   ovaries, and fallopian tubes. The acronyms "Gender-affirming surgery
   (GAS)" and "sex reassignment surgery" (SRS) refer to genital surgery.
   The term "sex reassignment therapy" (SRT) is used as an umbrella term
   for physical procedures required for transition. Use of the term "sex
   change" has been criticized for its emphasis on surgery, and the term
   "transition" is preferred.^[5]^[139] Availability of these procedures
   depends on degree of gender dysphoria, presence or absence of gender
   identity disorder,^[140] and standards of care in the relevant
   jurisdiction.

   Trans men who have not had a hysterectomy and who take testosterone are
   at increased risk for endometrial cancer because androstenedione, which
   is made from testosterone in the body, can be converted into estrogen,
   and external estrogen is a risk factor for endometrial cancer.^[141]

  Detransition

   Main article: Detransition

   Detransition refers to the cessation or reversal of a sex reassignment
   surgery or gender transition. Formal studies of detransition have been
   few in number,^[142] of disputed quality,^[143] and politically
   controversial.^[144] Estimates of the rate at which detransitioning
   occurs vary from less than 1% to as high as 13%.^[145] Those who
   undergo sex reassignment surgery have very low rates of detransition or
   regret.^[131]^[146]^[147]^[148]

   The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, with responses from 27,715
   individuals who identified as "transgender, trans, genderqueer, [or]
   non-binary", found that 8% of respondents reported some kind of
   detransition. "Most of those who de-transitioned did so only
   temporarily: 62% of those who had de-transitioned reported that they
   were currently living full time in a gender different than the gender
   they were thought to be at birth."^[79] Detransition was associated
   with assigned male sex at birth, nonbinary gender identity, and
   bisexual orientation, among other cohorts.^[147] Only 5% of
   detransitioners (or 0.4% of total respondents) reported doing so
   because gender transition was "not for them"; 82% cited external
   reason(s), including pressure from others, the difficulties of
   transition, and discrimination. "The most common reason cited for
   de-transitioning was pressure from a parent (36%)."^[149]^[150]^[79]

   transgender activist at a demonstration for transgender people in
   Paris, October 1, 2005

   Legal procedures exist in some jurisdictions which allow individuals to
   change their legal gender or name to reflect their gender identity.
   Requirements for these procedures vary from an explicit formal
   diagnosis of transsexualism, to a diagnosis of gender identity
   disorder, to a letter from a physician that attests the individual's
   gender transition or having established a different gender role.^[151]
   In 1994, the DSM IV entry was changed from "Transsexual" to "Gender
   Identity Disorder". In 2013, the DSM V removed "Gender Identity
   Disorder" and published "Gender Dysphoria" in its place.^[152] In many
   places, transgender people are not legally protected from
   discrimination in the workplace or in public accommodations.^[24] A
   report released in February 2011 found that 90% of transgender people
   faced discrimination at work and were unemployed at double the rate of
   the general population,^[22] and over half had been harassed or turned
   away when attempting to access public services.^[22] Members of the
   transgender community also encounter high levels of discrimination in
   health care.^[153]

  Europe

   A Welsh Government advisory video on transgender hate crimes

   36 countries in Europe require a mental health diagnosis for legal
   gender recognition and 20 countries require sterilisation.^[154] In
   April 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that requiring
   sterilisation for legal gender recognition violates human rights.^[155]

  Canada

   Main article: Transgender rights in Canada

   Jurisdiction over legal classification of sex in Canada is assigned to
   the provinces and territories. This includes legal change of gender
   classification. On June 19, 2017, Bill C-16, having passed the
   legislative process in the House of Commons of Canada and the Senate of
   Canada, became law upon receiving Royal Assent, which put it into
   immediate force.^[156]^[157]^[158] The law updated the Canadian Human
   Rights Act and the Criminal Code to include "gender identity and gender
   expression" as protected grounds from discrimination, hate publications
   and advocating transgender genocide. The bill also added "gender
   identity and expression" to the list of aggravating factors in
   sentencing, where the accused commits a criminal offence against an
   individual because of those personal characteristics. Similar
   transgender laws also exist in all the provinces and territories.^[159]

  United States

   Main article: Transgender rights in the United States

   In the United States, transgender people are protected from employment
   discrimination by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Exceptions
   apply to certain types of employers, for example, employers with fewer
   than 15 employees and religious organizations.^[160] In 2020, the U.S.
   Supreme Court affirmed that Title VII prohibits discrimination against
   transgender people in the case R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v.
   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.^[161]

   Nicole Maines, a trans girl, took a case to Maine's supreme court in
   June 2013. She argued that being denied access to her high school's
   women's restroom was a violation of Maine's Human Rights Act; one state
   judge has disagreed with her,^[162] but Maines won her lawsuit against
   the Orono school district in January 2014 before the Maine Supreme
   Judicial Court.^[163] On May 14, 2016, the United States Department of
   Education and Department of Justice issued guidance directing public
   schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their
   gender identities.^[164]

   On June 30, 2016, the United States Department of Defense removed the
   ban that prohibited transgender people from openly serving in the US
   military.^[165] On July 27, 2017, President Donald Trump tweeted that
   transgender Americans would not be allowed to serve "in any capacity"
   in the United States Armed Forces.^[166] Later that day, Joint Chiefs
   of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford announced, "there will be no
   modifications to the current policy until the president's direction has
   been received by the Secretary of Defense and the secretary has issued
   implementation guidance."^[167] Joe Biden later reversed Trump's policy
   when he became president in 2021.^[168]^[169]

  India

   Main article: LGBT rights in India § Transgender rights

   [220px-Jogappas_at_Bangalore.jpg] Jogappa is a transgender community in
   Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. They are traditional folk singers and
   dancers.

   In April 2014, the Supreme Court of India declared transgender to be a
   'third gender' in Indian law.^[170]^[171]^[172] The transgender
   community in India (made up of Hijras and others) has a long history in
   India and in Hindu mythology.^[173]^[174] Justice KS Radhakrishnan
   noted in his decision that, "Seldom, our society realizes or cares to
   realize the trauma, agony and pain which the members of Transgender
   community undergo, nor appreciates the innate feelings of the members
   of the Transgender community, especially of those whose mind and body
   disown their biological sex".^[175] Hijras have faced structural
   discrimination including not being able to obtain driving licenses, and
   being prohibited from accessing various social benefits. It is also
   common for them to be banished from communities.^[176]

  LGBT community

   See also: LGBT, LGBT community, and LGBT culture § Transgender culture

   Despite the distinction between sexual orientation and gender,
   throughout history gay, lesbian and bisexual subcultures were often the
   only places where gender-variant people were socially accepted in the
   gender role they felt they belonged to; especially during the time when
   legal or medical transitioning was almost impossible. This acceptance
   has had a complex history. Like the wider world, the gay community in
   Western societies did not generally distinguish between sex and gender
   identity until the 1970s, and the role of the transgender community in
   the history of LGBT rights is often overlooked.^[177]

   According to a study done at University of California, Los Angeles in
   2011, conducted in part by Gary J. Gates, 3.5% of adults across the
   United States identify as either gay, lesbian, or bisexuals whereas
   only 0.3% of adults identify as transgender.^[178] Transgender
   individuals have been part of various LGBT movements throughout
   history, with significant contributions dating back to the early days
   of the gay liberation movement.^[179]

   The LGBT community is not a monolithic group, and there are different
   modes of thought on who is a part of this diverse community. The
   changes that came with the Gay Liberation Movement and Civil Rights
   movement saw many gay, lesbian, and bisexual people making headway
   within the public sphere, and gaining support from the wider public,
   throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. The trans
   community only experienced a similar surge in activism during the start
   of the twenty-first century.^[180]^[179] Due to the many different
   groups that make up the broader LGBT movement, there are those within
   the larger community who do not believe that the trans community has a
   place within the LGBT space.^[180]^[181]

  Religion

   Main article: Transgender people and religion

   The Vatican's doctrine department has issued a recent ruling that
   allows Catholic baptism for transgender individuals and infants born to
   same-sex couples. Dated October 31, 2024, these new regulations stem
   from questions submitted by Brazilian bishop Giuseppe Negri to the
   dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF). The responses,
   addressing specific sacraments, were published on the Vatican's website
   in Italy. Concerning transgender individuals, the document states that
   they can undergo baptism like any other adult, as long as there is no
   potential for causing scandal or disorientation among other Catholics.

   If children identifying as transgender are adequately prepared and
   willing, they can receive baptism, according to the document.
   Additionally, it mentions that transgender individuals, including those
   who have undergone gender reassignment, can serve as godparents and
   witnesses in Catholic weddings under appropriate conditions. The
   document also allows the baptism of children from same-sex couples,
   provided there is a well-founded hope that they will receive Catholic
   religious education. The document emphasizes that individuals in
   same-sex relationships are regarded as committing a sin, and baptism is
   conditional upon repentance for such actions. Several sermons by Pope
   Francis are referenced in the document to support this ruling.^[182]

   The Church of England passed a motion at the 2017 General Synod, which
   would ensure Anglican churches accepted transgender people, even
   suggesting on their website that transgender people could be gifted a
   Bible with their new name inscribed to support them.^[183]

  Feminism

   Main articles: Feminist views on transgender topics and Transfeminism

   Feminist views on transgender women have changed over time, but have
   generally become more positive. Second-wave feminism saw numerous
   clashes opposed to transgender women, since they were not seen as
   "true" women, and as invading women-only spaces.^[184]^[185] Though
   second-wave feminism argued for the sex and gender distinction, some
   feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity
   and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female
   transition abandoned or devalued female identity and that transgender
   people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes.^[186] By the
   emergence of third-wave feminism (around 1990), opinions had shifted to
   being more inclusive of both trans and gay identities.^[187]^[188]
   Fourth-wave feminism (starting around 2012) has been widely
   trans-inclusive, but trans-exclusive groups and ideas remain as a
   minority, though one that is especially prominent in the
   UK.^[189]^[187]^[190] Feminists who do not accept that trans women are
   women have been labeled "trans-exclusionary radical feminists" (TERFs)
   or gender-critical feminists by opponents.^[191]^[192]

  Discrimination and support

   See also: Transphobia

   Transgender individuals experience significant rates of employment
   discrimination. Approximately 90% of trans people have encountered some
   form of harassment or mistreatment in their workplace. Moreover, 47%
   have experienced some form of adverse employment outcome due to being
   transgender; of this figure, 44% were passed over for a job, 23% were
   denied a promotion, and 26% were terminated on the grounds that they
   were transgender.^[193]

   Studies in several cultures have found that cisgender women are more
   likely to be accepting of trans people than cisgender
   men.^[194]^[195]^[196]^[197]

   The start of the twenty-first century saw the rise in transgender
   activism and with it an increase in support.^[179] Within the United
   States, groups such as the Trevor Project have been serving the wider
   LGBT community including people who identify with the term transgender.
   The group offers support in the form of educational resources including
   research, advocacy, and crisis services.^[198] The American Civil
   Liberties Unions (ACLU) is another group that fights legal battles in
   support of many different groups including those in the trans
   community.^[199]

   Other groups within the United States specifically advocate for
   transgender rights. One of these groups directly related to transgender
   support is the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE), which
   is committed to advocating for policy changes that protect transgender
   people and promote equality. Through their research, education, and
   advocacy efforts, the NCTE works to address issues such as healthcare
   access, employment discrimination, and legal recognition for
   transgender individuals.^[200] One prominent organization within Europe
   is Transgender Europe (TGEU), a network of organizations and
   individuals committed to promoting equality and human rights for
   transgender people within European borders. TGEU works to challenge
   discrimination, improve transgender healthcare access, advocate for
   legal recognition of gender identity, and support the well-being of
   transgender communities.^[201]

Population figures and prevalence

   See also: Transsexual § Prevalence

   Little is known about the prevalence of transgender people in the
   general population and reported prevalence estimates are greatly
   affected by variable definitions of transgender.^[202] According to a
   recent systematic review, an estimated 9.2 out of every 100,000 people
   have received or requested gender affirmation surgery or transgender
   hormone therapy; 6.8 out of every 100,000 people have received a
   transgender-specific diagnoses; and 355 out of every 100,000 people
   self-identify as transgender.^[202] These findings underscore the value
   of using consistent terminology related to studying the experience of
   transgender, as studies that explore surgical or hormonal gender
   affirmation therapy may or may not be connected with others that follow
   a diagnosis of "transsexualism", "gender identity disorder", or "gender
   dysphoria", none of which may relate with those that assess
   self-reported identity.^[202] Common terminology across studies does
   not yet exist, so population numbers may be inconsistent, depending on
   how they are being counted.

   A study in 2020 found that, since 1990, of those seeking sex hormone
   therapy for gender dysphoria there has been a steady increase in the
   percentage of trans men, such that they equal the number of trans women
   seeking this treatment.^[203]

  Asia

   [170px-Nongthoomfairtex.jpg] Nong Tum, a Kathoey internationally
   recognized for her portrayal in the film Beautiful Boxer

   In Thailand and Laos,^[204] the term kathoey is used to refer to
   male-to-female transgender people^[205] and effeminate gay men.^[206]
   However, many transgender people in Thailand do not identify as
   kathoey.^[207] Transgender people have also been documented in
   Iran,^[208] Japan,^[209] Nepal,^[210] Indonesia,^[211] Vietnam,^[212]
   South Korea,^[213] Jordan,^[214] Singapore,^[215] and the greater
   Chinese region, including Hong Kong,^[216]^[217] Taiwan,^[218] and the
   People's Republic of China.^[219]^[220]

   The cultures of the Indian subcontinent include a third gender,
   referred to as hijra in Hindi. In India, the Supreme Court on April 15,
   2014, recognized a third gender that is neither male nor female,
   stating "Recognition of transgenders as a third gender is not a social
   or medical issue but a human rights issue."^[221] In 1998, Shabnam
   Mausi became the first transgender person to be elected in India, in
   the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.^[222]

  Europe

   According to Amnesty International, 1.5 million transgender people live
   in the European Union (as at 2017), making up 0.3% of the
   population.^[223] A 2011 survey conducted by the Equality and Human
   Rights Commission in the UK found that of 10,026 respondents, 1.4%
   would be classified into a gender minority group. The survey also
   showed that 1% had gone through any part of a gender reassignment
   process (including thoughts or actions).^[224] In the England and Wales
   section of the 2021 United Kingdom census, 0.5% of respondents aged 16
   and over indicated that their gender identity was different from their
   sex assigned at birth.^[225]

  North America

   The 2021 Canadian census released by Statistics Canada found that
   59,460 Canadians (0.19% of the population) identified as
   transgender.^[226] According to the Survey of Safety in Public and
   Private Spaces by Statistics Canada in 2018, 0.24% of the Canadian
   population identified as transgender men, women or non-binary
   individuals.^[227]

   The Social Security Administration has tracked the sex of United States
   citizens since 1936.^[228] A 1968 estimate, by Ira B. Pauly, estimated
   that about 2,500 transsexual people were living in the United States,
   with four times as many trans women as trans men.^[229] One effort to
   quantify the modern population in 2011 gave a "rough estimate" that
   0.3% of adults in the US are transgender.^[230]^[231] More recent
   studies released in 2016 estimate the proportion of Americans who
   identify as transgender at 0.5 to 0.6%. This would put the total number
   of transgender Americans at approximately 1.4 million adults (as of
   2016^[update]).^[232]^[233]^[234]^[235]

   In the United States and Canada, some Native American and First Nations
   cultures traditionally recognize the existence of more than two
   genders,^[236] such as the Zuni male-bodied lhamana,^[237] the Lakota
   male-bodied winkte,^[238] and the Mohave male-bodied alyhaa and
   female-bodied hwamee.^[239] These traditional people, along with those
   from other North American Indigenous cultures, are sometimes part of
   the contemporary, pan-Indian two-spirit community.^[238] Historically,
   in most cultures who have alternate gender roles, if the spouse of a
   third gender person is not otherwise gender variant, they have not
   generally been regarded as other-gendered themselves, simply for being
   in a same-sex relationship.^[239] In Mexico, the Zapotec culture
   includes a third gender in the form of the Muxe.^[240] Mahu is a
   traditional third gender in Hawai'i and Tahiti. Mahu are valued as
   teachers, caretakers of culture, and healers, such as Kapaemahu. Diné
   (Navajo) have Nádleehi.^[115]

  Latin America

   In Latin American cultures, a travesti is an individual who has been
   assigned male at birth and who has a feminine, transfeminine, or
   "femme" gender identity. Travestis generally undergo hormonal
   treatment, use female gender expression including new names and
   pronouns from the masculine ones they were given when assigned a sex,
   and might use breast implants, but they are not offered or do not
   desire sex-reassignment surgery. Travesti might be regarded as a gender
   in itself (a "third gender"), a mix between man and woman
   ("intergender/androgynes"), or the presence of both masculine and
   feminine identities in a single person ("bigender"). They are framed as
   something entirely separate from transgender women, who possess the
   same gender identity of people assigned female at birth.^[241]

   Other transgender identities are becoming more widely known, as a
   result of contact with other cultures of the Western world.^[242] These
   newer identities, sometimes known under the umbrella use of the term
   "genderqueer",^[242] along with the older travesti term, are known as
   non-binary and go along with binary transgender identities (those
   traditionally diagnosed under the obsolete label of "transsexualism")
   under the single umbrella of transgender, but are distinguished from
   cross-dressers and drag queens and kings, that are held as
   nonconforming gender expressions rather than transgender gender
   identities when a distinction is made.^[243]

Culture

  Coming out

   Main article: Coming out

   Transgender people vary greatly in choosing when, whether, and how to
   disclose their transgender status to family, close friends, and others.
   The prevalence of discrimination and violence against transgender
   persons can make coming out a risky decision. Fear of retaliatory
   behavior, such as being removed from the parental home while underage,
   is a cause for transgender people to not come out to their families
   until they have reached adulthood.^[citation needed] Parental confusion
   and lack of acceptance of a transgender child may result in parents
   treating a newly revealed gender identity as a "phase" or making
   efforts to change their children back to "normal" by utilizing mental
   health services to alter the child's gender
   identity.^[244]^[better source needed]

   The internet can play a significant role in the coming out process for
   transgender people. Some come out in an online identity first,
   providing an opportunity to go through experiences virtually and safely
   before risking social sanctions in the real world.^[245]

   transgender issues, often taking place during the time of local Pride
   parades for LGBT people. These events are frequently organised by trans
   communities to build community, address human rights struggles, and
   create visibility.^[249]^[250]^[251]^[252] International Transgender
   Day of Visibility is an annual holiday occurring on March 31^[26]^[253]
   dedicated to celebrating transgender people and raising awareness of

   Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) is held every year on November 20
   in honor of Rita Hester, who was killed on November 28, 1998. Her
   murder remains unsolved, but was described in 2022 as "a result of
   transphobia and anti-trans violence" by the Office of the Mayor of
   Boston, Michelle Wu.^[25] TDOR memorializes victims of hate crimes and
   prejudice and raises awareness of hate crimes committed upon living
   transgender people.^[256] Transgender Awareness Week is a one-week
   celebration leading up to TDOR, dedicated to educating about
   transgender and gender non-conforming people and the issues associated
   with their transition or identity.^[257] Several trans marches occur in
   cities around the world, including Paris, San Francisco, and Toronto,
   in order to raise awareness of the transgender community.^[258]^[259]

   There are also significant portrayals of transgender people in the
   media. Transgender literature includes literature portraying
   transgender people, as well as memoirs or novels by transgender people,
   who often discuss elements of the transgender experience.^[260] Several
   films and television shows feature transgender characters in the
   storyline, and several fictional works also have notable transgender
   characters.^[261]

   A common symbol for the transgender community is the Transgender Pride
   Flag, which was designed by the American transgender woman Monica Helms
   in 1999, and was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona, in
   2000. The flag consists of five horizontal stripes: light blue, pink,
   white, pink, and light blue^[27] Other transgender symbols include the
   butterfly (symbolizing transformation or metamorphosis),^[262] and a
   pink/light blue yin and yang symbol.^[263] Several gender symbols have
   been used to represent transgender people, including mf. and
   xmf..^[264]^[265]

       writes:

       becomes an urge for gender ('sex') change, transvestism becomes
       'transsexualism.' The term is misleading; actually,

       Although Oliven's understanding of "transgender"is not the same as
       our understanding of it today, his use of it is still significant.
       As K.J. Rawson and Cristan Williams note in their book,
       "Transgender*: The Rhetorical Landscape of a Term," Oliven didn't
       use the word in the book's 1955 edition; it was added later, when
       the second edition was revised and published.
       Gradually, some members of this marginalized community began to
       apply the word "transgender"to themselves. For example, Virginia
       Charles Prince, publisher of the long-running periodical
       "Transvestia," occasionally used a variation of the word,
       "transgenderal.""

       re-assignment surgery. Richard Ekins established the Trans-Gender
       Archive, at the University of Ulster, in 1986 (Ekins, 1988). The
       term was chosen to provide an umbrella concept which avoided such
       medical categories as transsexual and transvestite; which included
       the widest possible range of transgender phenomena; and which took
       the sociological view that aspects of sex, sexuality and gender
       (not just gender), including the binary divide, all have socially
       constructed components. Not long afterwards, the 'transgender
       community' came to be used as an umbrella term to include

   LGBTQ Health Gender Affirmation

   The following health concerns are relevant to many transgender and
   gender-expansive people (sometimes called gender non-binary or gender
   diverse). While these issues may not apply to everyone, they are
   important for everyone and their health providers to consider.

Barriers to Health Care

   Some transgender people may not consult health care services because
   they have had negative experiences with doctors in the past. For that
   reason, organizations such as theWorld Professional Association for
   Transgender Health (WPATH)have created resources to help transgender
   people find knowledgeable, supportive, caring and compassionate
   providers in their communities.

   For the best care possible, people should feel empowered to take an
   active role in their health by:
     * Voicing concerns if something doesn't seem right.
     * Asking questions if they are unsure about any information.
     * Being forthcoming about any medications and past surgeries, as
       these may affect treatment plans and preventive care options.

Transgender Violence

   Transgender and gender-expansive people face a disproportionately high
   risk of physical and sexual violence in our society, much of which is
   motivated by hate or fear, and stems from a lack of understanding and
   acceptance. This violence can be perpetrated by loved ones, family and
   friends, or strangers, and can occur in the home, school, workplace or
   on the street.

Intimate Partner Violence

   Intimate partner violence (sometimes calleddomestic violence) involves
   physical or emotional harm by a significant other -- usually a partner,
   spouse or date. Typically, intimate partner violence begins with verbal
   threats and can escalate to physical abuse. Early recognition is
   important and individuals can seek help as soon as possible. Intimate
   partner violence often involves manipulation and control. Some of the
   barriers faced by gender-expansive survivors of intimate partner
   violence include:
     * Access to support services.
     * Lack of training on the part of service providers.
     * Discrimination in shelters.

   The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence has information on
   services and organizations that are inclusive and supportive of trans
   survivors. Research suggests that gender diverse people face intimate
   partner violence at much higher rates than other adults. However,
   victims may be hesitant to seek help because they fear discrimination
   from law enforcement and health care providers. Sadly, not all intimate
   partner violence resources accommodate transgender and gender-expansive
   people, but specific assistance is available in certain areas.

Workplace Discrimination

   Twenty-six percent of transgender and gender-expansive adults report
   being fired because of their identity. Because gender diverse people
   face such extreme job discrimination, some may turn to sex work as a
   last resort. This puts them at far greater risk of physical and sexual
   violence. Make sure you know your rights as an employee.

Sexual and Reproductive Health

Fertility Options

   Some gender-expansive people aspire to have children or be parents.
   Because of this, all reproductive options and future plans, such as
   sperm banking, should be discussed with individuals before medical or
   surgical procedures that may reduce their future reproductive options.

   Additionally, it's important for gender-expansive people and their
   families to find a provider or center that understands their specific
   needs and offers services in a caring and compassionate environment. If
   you are interested in your fertility options, please consider
   discussing this during your intake interview with the Johns Hopkins
   Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health.

The Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health Team at Johns Hopkins

   Embracing diversity and inclusion, the Center for Transgender and
   Gender Expansive Health provides affirming, objective, person-centered
   care to improve health and enhance wellness; educates interdisciplinary
   health care professionals to provide culturally competent,
   evidence-based care; informs the public on transgender health issues;
   and advances medical knowledge by conducting biomedical research.
   More about the Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health

Preventive Care and Screenings

   Sexual and reproductive health concerns for trans people may not be
   addressed due to the perception that people who have had gender
   affirmation surgery may not require clinical Pap tests, breast exams or
   prostate cancer screening.

   These stereotypes and associated discrimination may make it
   uncomfortable for some gender-expansive people to access these
   important health care services. But while it may be unpleasant or even
   traumatic for some trans people to bring up these issues, early
   detection is essential for catching cancers while they are still
   treatable.

   With that in mind, it is imperative that all individuals with a uterus,
   cervix, breasts or a prostate gland be offered regular preventive and
   diagnostic screenings for those organs.

Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)

   Some transgender people are at greater risk for certainSTIs. Aside from
   abstinence, the best method to prevent STIs is to use barriers, such as
   external condoms, internal condoms or dental dams, with every sexual
   encounter.

   Fearing rejection or danger, trans people may not pressure their
   partners to use condoms -- especially if sex work is involved or if the
   partner is violent. Barrier methods play an enormous role in STI
   prevention, so it is important for transgender and gender-expansive
   people to feel empowered to make safe sex decisions. There are a few
   sexually transmitted infections you should be aware of:

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

   HIV is a virus that can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome
   (AIDS) if left untreated. HIV impairs the immune system's ability to
   fight infections and certain cancers. HIV is spread through direct
   contact with body fluids that contain the virus -- often through needle
   sharing and anal, vaginal and (very rarely) oral sex. Knowing your HIV
   status is an important part of protecting yourself and others.

   Trans people at risk of HIV infection can talk with their health care
   provider about taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV.
   PrEP is a drug that, when combined with consistent condom use, can
   minimize HIV transmission. Ask your primary care clinician if PrEP is
   right for you.

Syphilis

   Syphilis is a bacterial infection that causes small painless sores on
   your genitalia. It can harm the heart and nervous system if not treated
   in a timely manner. Syphilis is transmitted through oral, anal and
   vaginal sex.

Gonorrhea

   Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection that causes painful urination and
   excessive discharge from the vagina or penis. It can lead to fertility
   complications if left untreated. Gonorrhea is passed between partners
   through oral, anal and vaginal sex. New, more drug-resistant strains
   are becoming increasingly common. It is important to be tested to
   ensure adequate treatment.

Chlamydia

   Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that causes painful urination,
   excessive vaginal discharge, and sometimes testicular swelling. Often
   times there are no symptoms for the first few weeks. If left untreated,
   chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic
   pregnancy, infertility, and long term pelvic pain. Chlamydia is passed
   between partners through oral, anal and vaginal sex. It is important to
   be tested and treated for chlamydia in a timely manner.

Hepatitis A and B

   Hepatitis Aandhepatitis Bare viral infections that cause damage to the
   liver. Hepatitis A is mostly spread through contaminated food but can
   also be spread through anal and oral sex. Hepatitis B is transmitted
   through needle sharing and anal, oral and vaginal sex. Hepatitis A
   infections usually clear on their own, but hepatitis B can cause
   permanent or chronic damage to the liver, resulting in liver cancer.

   Vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B are available, and transgender
   people should discuss them with their health care provider to ensure
   initial vaccinations and booster shots are received.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV)

   HPV is a group of viruses that can cause genital warts and certain
   cancers. HPV is spread through oral, anal and vaginal sex. A vaccine
   may be able to protect some people from the forms of HPV that can lead
   to certain cancers.

Other Infections

   Meningitis is most often spread through germs in coughs and sneezes,
   but can also be passed to others through close contact. People with
   compromised immune systems -- for example, those living with HIV or
   AIDS -- are especially at risk. People should talk to their health care
   providers about immunization against meningitis.

Substance Use Disorder

   Gender-expansive people are more likely than the general population to
   drink alcohol and smoke, and these behaviors are often linked to the
   high levels of discrimination and lack of acceptance faced by trans
   individuals in our society.

   This is a very important health concern because the use of these
   substances is linked to substance use disorder, multiple forms of
   cancer and conditions of the heart and lungs. Among other dangerous
   health effects, tobacco use puts people at much higher risk for several
   cancers. It also contributes to wound healing complications if you
   decide to proceed with gender affirming surgery. Excessive alcohol use
   contributes to permanent liver damage and risky sexual behaviors. The
   use of illicit substances can increase risk for some of the infections
   listed above. Drug use or misuse use may also impair psychological
   stability and lead to further mental health problems.

   Trans people who do not have reliable access to hormones from their
   doctor may try to get them elsewhere. In proper doses, hormones are
   safe, but they should be prescribed and monitored by a physician to
   guard against dangerous side effects.

Silicone Injections

   The use of unmonitored silicone injections is also a health concern for
   trans people who may be unable to access professional cosmetic surgery.
   These illegal injections often contain toxic ingredients and can lead
   to severe disfigurement and even death.

     * Also trans .

usage note For transgender

   The term transgender has largely replaced the older term transsexual,
   which is now considered outdated, though some people within the
   community continue to identify with the word transsexual, especially
   older people. Transgender is a less clinical term, referring more to
   gender identity and gender expression than to physical sex
   characteristics or sexual orientation. It is also a more general and
   inclusive term: a transgender person may be nonbinary, gender-fluid,
   genderqueer, third gender, etc.
   Use of transgender as a noun (One of my colleagues is a transgender )
   is declining and is usually taken as offensive. And many people object
   to the adjectival variant transgendered (One of my colleagues is
   transgendered ) because the -ed suffix seems to imply that something
   happened to make the person transgender. See also trans, transsexual.
     * Compare cisgender.
     * See also trans*.

   two transgender individuals standing next to each other

   According to the APA Style guide, the term "transsexual" is largely
   outdated, but some people identify with it; this term should be used
   only for an individual who specifically claims it. While the term
   "transsexual" appears multiple times throughout this document, APA's
   Committee on Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity is undertaking a
   systematic review of its use along with other terms. In the meantime,
   please refer to the Guidelines for Psychological Practice with
   Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People (PDF, 472KB) for more
   up-to-date language regarding transgender and gender nonconforming
   people.

   Transgender is an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity,
   gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically
   associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth. Gender
   identity refers to a person's internal sense of being male, female or
   something else; gender expression refers to the way a person
   communicates gender identity to others through behavior, clothing,
   hairstyles, voice or body characteristics. "Trans" is sometimes used as
   shorthand for "transgender." While transgender is generally a good term
   to use, not everyone whose appearance or behavior is
   gender-nonconforming will identify as a transgender person. The ways
   that transgender people are talked about in popular culture, academia
   and science are constantly changing, particularly as individuals'
   awareness, knowledge and openness about transgender people and their
   experiences grow.

What is the difference between sex and gender?

   Sex is assigned at birth, refers to one's biological status as either
   male or female, and is associated primarily with physical attributes
   such as chromosomes, hormone prevalence, and external and internal
   anatomy. Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors,
   activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate
   for boys and men or girls and women. These influence the ways that
   people act, interact, and feel about themselves. While aspects of
   biological sex are similar across different cultures, aspects of gender
   may differ.

   Various conditions that lead to atypical development of physical sex
   characteristics are collectively referred to as intersex conditions.

Have transgender people always existed?

   Transgender persons have been documented in many indigenous, Western,
   and Eastern cultures and societies from antiquity until the present
   day. However, the meaning of gender nonconformity may vary from culture
   to culture.

What are some categories or types of transgender people?

   Many identities fall under the transgender umbrella. The term
   transsexual refers to people whose gender identity is different from
   their assigned sex. Often, transsexual people alter or wish to alter
   their bodies through hormones, surgery, and other means to make their
   bodies as congruent as possible with their gender identities. This
   process of transition through medical intervention is often referred to
   as sex or gender reassignment, but more recently is also referred to as
   gender affirmation. People who were assigned female, but identify and
   live as male and alter or wish to alter their bodies through medical
   intervention to more closely resemble their gender identity are known
   as transsexual men or transmen (also known as female-to-male or FTM).
   Conversely, people who were assigned male, but identify and live as
   female and alter or wish to alter their bodies through medical
   intervention to more closely resemble their gender identity are known
   as transsexual women or transwomen (also known as male-to-female or
   MTF). Some individuals who transition from one gender to another prefer
   to be referred to as a man or a woman, rather than as transgender.

   People who cross-dress wear clothing that is traditionally or
   stereotypically worn by another gender in their culture. They vary in
   how completely they cross-dress, from one article of clothing to fully
   cross-dressing. Those who cross-dress are usually comfortable with
   their assigned sex and do not wish to change it. Cross-dressing is a
   form of gender expression and is not necessarily tied to erotic
   activity. Cross-dressing is not indicative of sexual orientation. (See
   Answers to Your Questions: For a Better Understanding of Sexual
   Orientation and Homosexuality for more information on sexual
   orientation.) The degree of societal acceptance for cross-dressing
   varies for males and females. In some cultures, one gender may be given
   more latitude than another for wearing clothing associated with a
   different gender.

   The term drag queens generally refers to men who dress as women for the
   purpose of entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events. The
   term drag kings refers to women who dress as men for the purpose of
   entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events.

   Genderqueer is a term that some people use who identify their gender as
   falling outside the binary constructs of "male" and "female." They may
   define their gender as falling somewhere on a continuum between male
   and female, or they may define it as wholly different from these terms.
   They may also request that pronouns be used to refer to them that are
   neither masculine nor feminine, such as "zie" instead of "he" or "she,"
   or "hir" instead of "his" or "her." Some genderqueer people do not
   identify as transgender.

   Other categories of transgender people include androgynous,
   multigendered, gender nonconforming, third gender, and two-spirit
   people. Exact definitions of these terms vary from person to person and
   may change over time, but often include a sense of blending or
   alternating genders. Some people who use these terms to describe
   themselves see traditional, binary concepts of gender as restrictive.

Why are some people transgender?

   There is no single explanation for why some people are transgender. The
   diversity of transgender expression and experiences argues against any
   simple or unitary explanation. Many experts believe that biological
   factors such as genetic influences and prenatal hormone levels, early
   experiences, and experiences later in adolescence or adulthood may all
   contribute to the development of transgender identities.

How prevalent are transgender people?

   It is difficult to accurately estimate the number of transgender
   people, mostly because there are no population studies that accurately
   and completely account for the range of gender identity and gender
   expression.

What is the relationship between gender identity and sexual orientation?

   Gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same. Sexual
   orientation refers to an individual's enduring physical, romantic,
   and/or emotional attraction to another person, whereas gender identity
   refers to one's internal sense of being male, female, or something
   else. Transgender people may be straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or
   asexual, just as nontransgender people can be. Some recent research has
   shown that a change or a new exploration period in partner attraction
   may occur during the process of transition. However, transgender people
   usually remain as attached to loved ones after transition as they were
   before transition. Transgender people usually label their sexual
   orientation using their gender as a reference. For example, a
   transgender woman, or a person who is assigned male at birth and
   transitions to female, who is attracted to other women would be
   identified as a lesbian or gay woman. Likewise, a transgender man, or a
   person who is assigned female at birth and transitions to male, who is
   attracted to other men would be identified as a gay man.

How does someone know that they are transgender?

   Transgender people experience their transgender identity in a variety
   of ways and may become aware of their transgender identity at any age.
   Some can trace their transgender identities and feelings back to their
   earliest memories. They may have vague feelings of "not fitting in"
   with people of their assigned sex or specific wishes to be something
   other than their assigned sex. Others become aware of their transgender
   identities or begin to explore and experience gender-nonconforming
   attitudes and behaviors during adolescence or much later in life. Some
   embrace their transgender feelings, while others struggle with feelings
   of shame or confusion. Those who transition later in life may have
   struggled to fit in adequately as their assigned sex only to later face
   dissatisfaction with their lives. Some transgender people, transsexuals
   in particular, experience intense dissatisfaction with their sex
   assigned at birth, physical sex characteristics, or the gender role
   associated with that sex. These individuals often seek gender-affirming
   treatments.

What should parents do if their child appears to be transgender or gender
nonconforming?

   Parents may be concerned about a child who appears to be
   gender-nonconforming for a variety of reasons. Some children express a
   great deal of distress about their assigned sex at birth or the gender
   roles they are expected to follow. Some children experience difficult
   social interactions with peers and adults because of their gender
   expression. Parents may become concerned when what they believed to be
   a "phase" does not pass. Parents of gender-nonconforming children may
   need to work with schools and other institutions to address their
   children's particular needs and ensure their children's safety. It is
   helpful to consult with mental health and medical professionals
   familiar with gender issues in children to decide how to best address
   these concerns. It is not helpful to force the child to act in a more
   gender-conforming way. Peer support from other parents of
   gender-nonconforming children may also be helpful.

How do transgender individuals make a gender transition?

   Transitioning from one gender to another is a complex process and may
   involve transition to a gender that is neither traditionally male nor
   female. People who transition often start by expressing their preferred
   gender in situations where they feel safe. They typically work up to
   living full time as members of their preferred gender by making many
   changes a little at a time. While there is no "right" way to transition
   genders, there are some common social changes transgender people
   experience that may involve one or more of the following: adopting the
   appearance of the desired sex through changes in clothing and grooming,
   adopting a new name, changing sex designation on identity documents (if
   possible), using hormone therapy treatment, and/or undergoing medical
   procedures that modify their body to conform with their gender
   identity.

   Every transgender person's process or transition differs. Because of
   this, many factors may determine how the individual wishes to live and
   express their gender identity. Finding a qualified mental health
   professional who is experienced in providing affirmative care for
   transgender people is an important first step. A qualified professional
   can provide guidance and referrals to other helping professionals.
   Connecting with other transgender people through peer support groups
   and transgender community organizations is also helpful.

   The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), a
   professional organization devoted to the treatment of transgender
   people, publishes The Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders,
   which offers recommendations for the provision of gender affirmation
   procedures and services.

Is being transgender a mental disorder?

   A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes
   significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not
   experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that
   identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For
   these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable
   resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and
   the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity
   and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress,
   including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect
   experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead
   many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related
   disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
   (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence
   can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria." Some contend that the
   diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should
   be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the
   diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of
   Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its
   current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as
   "gender identity disorder."

What kinds of discrimination do transgender people face?

   Anti-discrimination laws in most U.S. cities and states do not protect
   transgender people from discrimination based on gender identity or
   gender expression. Consequently, transgender people in most cities and
   states face discrimination in nearly every aspect of their lives. The
   National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and
   Lesbian Task Force released a report in 2011 entitled Injustice at
   Every Turn, which confirmed the pervasive and severe discrimination
   faced by transgender people. Out of a sample of nearly 6,500
   transgender people, the report found that transgender people experience
   high levels of discrimination in employment, housing, health care,
   education, legal systems, and even in their families.

   Transgender people may also have additional identities that may affect
   the types of discrimination they experience. Groups with such
   additional identities include transgender people of racial, ethnic, or
   religious minority backgrounds; transgender people of lower
   socioeconomic statuses; transgender people with disabilities;
   transgender youth; transgender elderly; and others. Experiencing
   discrimination may cause significant amounts of psychological stress,
   often leaving transgender individuals to wonder whether they were
   discriminated against because of their gender identity or gender
   expression, another sociocultural identity, or some combination of all
   of these.

   According to the study, while discrimination is pervasive for the
   majority of transgender people, the intersection of anti-transgender
   bias and persistent, structural racism is especially severe. People of
   color in general fare worse than White transgender people, with African
   American transgender individuals faring far worse than all other
   transgender populations examined.

   Many transgender people are the targets of hate crimes. They are also
   the victims of subtle discrimination--which includes everything from
   glances or glares of disapproval or discomfort to invasive questions
   about their body parts.

How can I be supportive of transgender family members, friends, or
significant others?

     * Educate yourself about transgender issues by reading books,
       attending conferences, and consulting with transgender experts. Be
       aware of your attitudes concerning people with gender-nonconforming
       appearance or behavior.
     * Know that transgender people have membership in various
       sociocultural identity groups (e.g., race, social class, religion,
       age, disability, etc.) and there is not one universal way to look
       or be transgender.
     * Use names and pronouns that are appropriate to the person's gender
       presentation and identity; if in doubt, ask.
     * Don't make assumptions about transgender people's sexual
       orientation, desire for hormonal or medical treatment, or other
       aspects of their identity or transition plans. If you have a reason
       to know (e.g., you are a physician conducting a necessary physical
       exam or you are a person who is interested in dating someone that
       you've learned is transgender), ask.
     * Don't confuse gender nonconformity with being transgender. Not all
       people who appear androgynous or gender nonconforming identify as
       transgender or desire gender affirmation treatment.
     * Keep the lines of communication open with the transgender person in
       your life.
     * Get support in processing your own reactions. It can take some time
       to adjust to seeing someone you know well transitioning. Having
       someone close to you transition will be an adjustment and can be
       challenging, especially for partners, parents, and children.
     * Seek support in dealing with your feelings. You are not alone.
       Mental health professionals and support groups for family, friends,
       and significant others of transgender people can be useful
       resources.
     * Advocate for transgender rights, including social and economic
       justice and appropriate psychological care.Familiarize yourself
       with the local and state or provincial laws that protect
       transgender people from discrimination.

Abstract

   Background. Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs
   from the sex they were assigned at birth. The population size of
   transgender individuals in the United States is not well-known, in part
   because official records, including the US Census, do not include data
   on gender identity. Population surveys today more often collect
   transgender-inclusive gender-identity data, and secular trends in
   culture and the media have created a somewhat more favorable
   environment for transgender people.

   Objectives. To estimate the current population size of transgender
   individuals in the United States and evaluate any trend over time.

   Search methods. In June and July 2016, we searched PubMed, Cumulative
   Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science for
   national surveys, as well as "gray" literature, through an Internet
   search. We limited the search to 2006 through 2016.

   Selection criteria. We selected population-based surveys that used
   probability sampling and included self-reported transgender-identity
   data.

   Data collection and analysis. We used random-effects meta-analysis to
   pool eligible surveys and used meta-regression to address our
   hypothesis that the transgender population size estimate would increase
   over time. We used subsample and leave-one-out analysis to assess for
   bias.

   Main results. Our meta-regression model, based on 12 surveys covering
   2007 to 2015, explained 62.5% of model heterogeneity, with a
   significant effect for each unit increase in survey year (F = 17.122;
   df = 1,10; b = 0.026%; P = .002). Extrapolating these results to 2016
   suggested a current US population size of 390 adults per 100 000, or
   almost 1 million adults nationally. This estimate may be more
   indicative for younger adults, who represented more than 50% of the
   respondents in our analysis.

   Authors' conclusions. Future national surveys are likely to observe
   higher numbers of transgender people. The large variety in questions
   used to ask about transgender identity may account for residual
   heterogeneity in our models.

   Public health implications. Under- or nonrepresentation of transgender
   individuals in population surveys is a barrier to understanding social
   determinants and health disparities faced by this population. We
   recommend using standardized questions to identify respondents with
   transgender and nonbinary gender identities, which will allow a more
   accurate population size estimate.

PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY

   We used data from national surveys to estimate the population size of
   transgender people in the United States. Estimates of the number of
   transgender adults significantly increased over the past decade, with a
   current best estimate of 390 per 100 000 adults. That is about 1 in
   every 250 adults, or almost 1 million Americans. These numbers may be
   more typical of younger adults than of the entire US population. We
   expect that future surveys will find higher numbers of transgender
   people and recommend that standardized questions be used, which will
   allow a more accurate population size estimate.

   Meta-Regression Showing the Proportion of Transgender Adults Against
   Survey Year

   Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs from the
   sex they were assigned at birth.^1 Research has shown that transgender
   individuals around the world and in the United States are exposed to
   widespread social stigma, discrimination, harassment, and physical and
   sexual abuse.^2,3 Compared with the general population, a national
   survey conducted in the United States in 2008 found that transgender
   individuals were 4 times more likely to live in extreme poverty, had
   double the rate of unemployment, and had almost double the rate of
   being homeless.^4 In terms of health, transgender individuals had 4
   times the rate of being HIV-infected and 28% postponed medical care
   because of discrimination. Particularly alarming is that 41% of survey
   respondents reported at least 1 suicide attempt. A barrier to
   understanding social determinants and health disparities faced by
   transgender people is the under- or nonrepresentation in a range of
   demographic and health-monitoring activities,^5 which may result from a
   lack of transgender-inclusive data collection with regard to gender
   identity.

   Accurate representation of the transgender population is complicated by
   the diversity within the community with regard to language and
   subcultures.^6,7 Moreover, the clinical literature has long conflated
   transgender identity with homosexuality.^8,9 Although a relationship
   between gender identity and sexual orientation may exist, the American
   Psychological Association (APA) recognizes that "Transgender people,
   like cis-gender people, may be sexually oriented toward men, women,
   both sexes, or neither sex. . . ."^10,11 Current best practice for
   collecting transgender-inclusive gender identity data is the 2-step
   method, which has been shown to optimize accurate identification of
   transgender people in a population.^12 This method records current
   gender identity as well as the sex assigned at birth; transgender
   people are those who identify as such and those whose current gender
   identity and sex assigned at birth differ.^13 This method allows the
   capture of people who identify with a binary gender (male or female),
   such as a transgender man who identifies only as male,^14 as well as
   others who may be considered transgender from a demographic
   perspective, even if they do not identify with the term "transgender,"
   such as people who identify as genderqueer, agender, or having no
   gender.^15,16

   The US Census and other official records kept by such agencies as the
   National Archives or state departments of motor vehicles report sex,
   typically based on the sex assigned at birth or the legal sex, but they
   do not report current gender identity. They are also not able to record
   whether the legal sex differs from the sex assigned at birth. As a
   result, at the most basic level, the population size of transgender
   individuals in the United States is not well-known.

   On the basis of a limited number of sources in 2009, the APA estimated
   the number of transgender individuals in the United States at 115 000
   to 450 000, or 38 to 147 per 100 000 by using US Census data for that
   year's total population size.^11 The value of these numbers is limited,
   as the lower limit was based on members of a lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   and transgender (LGBT) Web site who identified as transgender, which is
   unlikely to be representative of the US general population, and the
   upper limit was based on an older and in part nonprobability sample of
   North Americans,^17 which may not reflect current numbers in the United
   States. More recent US population-based surveys have reported
   transgender population sizes that are higher, ranging from 153 to 1647
   per 100 000.^18 These estimates may not generalize to the United States
   as a whole, as they were based on data collected in Massachusetts
   adults^19 and 9th to 12th graders in Boston public schools.^20 Perhaps
   the best current estimate is provided by Flores et al. who estimated
   that 0.6% of US adults, approximately 560 per 100 000, identify as
   transgender.^21 They used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is administered annually to randomly
   selected adults across the United States.

   Because contemporary surveys more often collect transgender-inclusive
   gender-identity data, and secular trends in culture and the media have
   created a somewhat more favorable environment for transgender people,
   it is possible that the measured size of the transgender population has
   increased over time, rendering previous reports of population size even
   less applicable today. The primary aim of this study was to estimate
   the number of transgender individuals in the United States by
   performing a meta-analysis of population-based national surveys. A
   secondary aim was to evaluate for any trend over time. We hypothesized
   that the estimates of transgender population size would increase over
   time. Knowledge of the transgender population size can support the
   development of social policy that aims to protect transgender
   individuals against stigma and discrimination. From a health
   perspective, knowledge of the size of the transgender population can
   inform the development of health care programs to benefit transgender
   people, as well as inform insurance companies on how to best provide
   coverage for such care.

METHODS

   We systematically searched for national surveys in PubMed, Cumulative
   Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science. The
   search was limited to 2006 to 2016, as older surveys are unlikely to
   contain transgender-inclusive gender-identity data. Eligible surveys
   were population-based and nonclinical, as recommended by Deutsch,^18
   and collected data on transgender identity in probability samples. The
   search combined the terms "national" and "survey" in titles or
   abstracts with "gender identity" anywhere in the publication and was
   performed on July 5, 2016. Knowing that large national surveys often
   have dedicated Web pages that report methods and data (e.g., the BRFSS,
   the National Health Interview Survey [NHIS]), we also searched the
   Internet for "gray" literature with the search terms "survey,"
   "gender," and "health" in the Internet domains ".gov," ".edu," and
   ".us," which are the domains affiliated with the United States. We
   performed this search with the Google search engine between June 1 and
   13, 2016. We included the search term "health" to narrow these Internet
   search results, assuming that surveys with transgender-inclusive
   gender-identity data would most likely be health-related.

   With the Internet search results ordered by relevance, we identified US
   surveys among the first 500 hits. We revisited Web sites for recurring
   surveys to check for new data until November 9, 2016. Across both
   searches, we excluded satisfaction surveys, surveys that were not based
   on self-report (e.g., parents reporting about children), surveys that
   were not about humans (e.g., tobacco-free colleges, health plans or
   health insurance, LGBT curriculum content), surveys that were not based
   on national samples (e.g., surveys covering state, county, or cities
   only), and reviews and meta-analyses of multiple surveys. We further
   excluded surveys that did not specifically report transgender
   identities (e.g., surveys that reported counts for "another gender" or
   counts for a response option that combined "transgender" and "other").
   We collected gender-identity data for each unique survey located
   through either the Internet search or search in traditional scientific
   databases from the original search result or reports on the survey's
   Web site.

   We completed an investigator-developed data extraction form for each
   eligible survey with data on survey year, population, sampling design,
   question(s) used to assess transgender identity, and the total sample
   size and number who self-reported as transgender. The first author
   extracted and double-checked all data.

   We conducted random-effects meta-analyses based on the proportion of
   transgender individuals. Pooling of multiple survey samples, including
   multiple waves for recurring surveys, has been used before to estimate
   population size in gender and sexual minorities.^22,23 Random-effects
   analysis is appropriate when study heterogeneity can be expected.^24 We
   present plots and calculated the I^2 statistic to estimate residual
   heterogeneity. This statistic indicates whether variation is more
   likely attributable to study heterogeneity or to chance.^25 To assess
   potential bias we conducted subsample analysis and leave-one-out
   analysis to test whether single surveys had a disproportionally large
   effect. We used meta-regression to assess our hypothesis regarding a
   trend in estimated population size over time. We used the Knapp-Hartung
   method to control type-I error in meta-regressions.^26 We used R
   version 3.2.2 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) for all statistical
   analyses.

RESULTS

   We initially identified 65 surveys. After we excluded duplicates and
   surveys that did not meet our eligibility criteria, 5 surveys remained
   for analysis, spanning 2006 to 2016 (Figure 1). Accounting for data
   from multiple waves of recurring surveys (4 out of 5), our final
   analysis included 20 samples. Table 1 describes each of these samples
   in more detail. Among them, 6 samples (30%) were drawn from the general
   population and 14 (70%) from college and university students and adult
   inmates. It is worth mentioning that only the BRFSS samples and the
   2016 wave of the National College Health Assessment (NCHA) collected
   data on gender identities not captured by the terms male, female, or
   transgender (e.g., genderqueer, gender-nonconforming), and that only
   the 2014 wave of the National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) and the 2016
   NCHA inquired after sex assigned at birth.^27-30

Survey Questions

   Questions used to collect data on transgender identity varied greatly.
   A majority of surveys (n = 13 or 65%) asked about being transgender in
   the context of gender identity, in accordance with current
   understanding that transgender is a gender identity that is different
   from a person's sex assigned at birth.^1 These surveys included the
   2014 and 2015 BRFSS,^27,28 the NCHA starting with the 2009 wave of data
   collection,^30-37 and the National Inmate Survey.^38-42 The remaining
   surveys (n = 7 or 35%) offered "transgender" as a response option in
   the context of sexual-orientation questions. These surveys included the
   2013 NHIS,^43 the NATS,^29,44,45 and the NCHA before the 2009 wave of
   data collection.^46-48 Although transgender as sexual orientation does
   not reflect current understanding of transgender as a gender identity,
   and sexual orientation and gender identity are distinct
   phenomena,^8,11,14 we conducted separate meta-analyses for
   "transgender" collected as gender identity and "transgender" as sexual
   orientation for the sake of comparison.

   Questions that probed gender identity included "Do you consider
   yourself to be transgender?"; "Do you identify as transgender?"; "Are
   you male, female, or transgender?"; and "What is your gender?" In
   addition to male or female gender options, response options included
   "transgender"^31,38 and "male-to-female," "female-to-male," and
   "gender-nonconforming."^27 Sexual-orientation questions with
   transgender response options included "Which of the following best
   describes you?"; "Which of the following best represents how you think
   of yourself?"; and "Do you consider yourself to be. . . ?" or "Do you
   think of yourself as. . .?" Response options included "transgender,"^45
   "transgendered,"^46 and "You are transgender, transsexual, or gender
   variant."^29,43

Transgender Population Size

   The estimated proportion of transgender individuals based on surveys
   that categorized transgender as gender identity was 0.39% (95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 0.16, 0.62; I^2 = 99.8%; k = 13). In terms
   of overall sample proportion, college and university students
   represented the majority (58%), followed by general-population adults
   (24%) and adult inmates (18%). Leave-one-out analysis of these surveys
   showed a marked effect on the population estimate when the 2016 NCHA
   was left out (0.28%; 95% CI = 0.23, 0.32; I^2 = 96.4%). Figure 2 shows
   a forest plot with the individual survey contributions. To assess the
   effect of including recurring surveys, we reanalyzed the data while
   including only the latest wave and leaving out the 2016 NCHA as a
   potential outlier. The estimated proportion of transgender individuals
   when we used this reduced data set spanning 2012 to 2015 was 0.35% (95%
   CI = 0.24, 0.46; I^2 = 96.8%; k = 3). The 2014 NATS and the 2016 NCHA
   respectively reported that 0.31% and 1.3% of respondents had indicated
   a sex assigned at birth that differed from their current gender
   identity. These respondents were not included in our population-size
   estimates.^29,30

   To test the hypothesis for changes over time, we conducted a
   meta-regression with the estimated proportion of transgender
   individuals as a dependent variable for surveys that categorized
   transgender as gender identity, but leaving out the 2016 NCHA as a
   potential outlier. A meta-regression model that included the year of
   the survey as predictor, centered with respect to 2007, explained 62.5%
   of model heterogeneity, with a significant effect for each unit
   increase in survey year (F = 17.122; df = 1,10; b = 0.026%; P = .002).
   A test for residual heterogeneity was also significant (QE = 99.687; df
   = 10; P < .001). Figure 3 visualizes the results of this
   meta-regression. Not surprisingly, the annual increase was considerably
   larger when we included 2016 NCHA (F = 4.944; df = 1,11; b = 0.086%; P
   = .048).

   The estimated proportion of transgender individuals based on surveys
   that categorized transgender as sexual orientation was 0.06% (95% CI =
   0.03, 0.09; I^2 = 96.6%; k = 7). It should be noted that presenting
   transgender in the context of sexual orientation does not reflect our
   current understanding of what it means to be transgender. We include
   these data for comparison only and doing so should not be taken as
   validation that presenting transgender as a sexual orientation is in
   any way appropriate. Leave-one-out analysis showed no disproportionate
   effect of single surveys. A direct comparison of estimates showed that
   the proportion for transgender categorized as sexual orientation was
   significantly lower than the overall proportion for transgender
   categorized as gender identity (0.06% vs 0.28%; t = 7.317; P < .001,
   corrected for unequal variances).

DISCUSSION

   Our meta-regression of US population-based surveys indicated a
   substantial annual increase in the number of transgender adults in the
   United States. As a consequence, meta-analyses that pool data across
   several years, including our own, will likely underestimate their
   numbers. A conservative estimate extrapolating our meta-regression
   results, while excluding the latest NCHA wave of data as a potential
   outlier, suggests that the proportion of transgender adults in the
   United States is 0.39%, or 390 per 100 000, and almost 1 million adults
   nationally. It should be noted that this estimate may be more
   indicative for younger adults and that national surveys in the near
   future may observe higher numbers of transgender people. We speculate
   that the observed annual increase is not an increase of the true
   population size, but the result of people feeling freer to report that
   they are or identify as transgender. This may result from societal
   changes, such as increased public visibility, awareness, and acceptance
   of transgender individuals.^49 The fact that US society is more aware
   of transgender issues is also reflected in public interest in the
   search term "transgender," which, according to Google Trends, has
   steadily increased since 2011. PubMed results for the number of
   publications found with the search term "transgender" show a similar
   phenomenon, with relatively small increases since 2005, but large
   increases in the number of publications since 2011.

   Comparison of our population-size estimate with international numbers
   is not straightforward because, even within a single country,
   differences in social acceptance affect the number of individuals who
   are willing to self-report a transgender identity.^50 This is why we
   based our analysis on US national samples only. Our estimate of 0.39%
   is not quite as high as the 1% that was posited on the basis of a
   qualitative review of international studies.^51 However, this high
   number was supported by new data from a Dutch population sample aged 15
   to 70 years, which found that 1.1% of men and 0.8% of women experienced
   a gender identity incongruent with their sex assigned at birth.^52 Our
   estimate is also lower than the 0.6% reported by Flores et al., who
   applied a rigorous statistical technique to extrapolate data from a
   single survey administered in 19 states to a national level.^21

"Transgender" as a Label

   The label "transgender" is often used as an umbrella term, but does not
   fully capture the larger gender-nonconforming or gender-variant
   population, as surveys in our analysis illustrated. In both waves of
   the BRFSS included in our analysis, more than 20% of respondents
   endorsed "gender-nonconforming." Other surveys that were not eligible
   for our analysis showed an even starker contrast between "transgender"
   and other nonbinary options. In a recent national nonprobability
   sample, the number of respondents who endorsed "genderqueer or gender
   nonconforming" was about 1.5 times the number who endorsed
   "transgender."^53 In the 2013 and 2015 Minnesota College Student Health
   Survey, twice as many respondents endorsed "genderqueer" or "another
   gender" than "transgender."^54,55

   Other surveys that were not included in our analysis because they
   specifically recruited LGBT individuals also indicated a sizable
   proportion of respondents who endorsed other gender options. For
   example, 6th- to 12th-grade students in a national sample endorsed
   "genderqueer" more often than "transgender," and the number who
   endorsed "another gender" was almost half of those who endorsed
   "transgender."^15 In a national survey of LGBT individuals in science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics, again, more endorsed
   "genderqueer" than "transgender," whereas the number who endorsed
   "androgynous" was slightly more than half of those who endorsed
   "transgender."^16

   Also, not all transgender people identify with the term "transgender"
   (e.g., a transgender woman who identifies as female only).^14,56 As
   such, surveys that include "transgender" as the only option other than
   male or female are likely to underestimate the population size under
   the transgender umbrella. The available evidence suggests that the size
   of the gender-nonconforming or gender-variant population may be twice
   as large as our best estimate for the transgender population size.

   According to our analysis, surveys that considered transgender a sexual
   orientation resulted in at least a 4-fold underestimate of the number
   of transgender individuals. This underestimate should not come as a
   surprise, because transgender as sexual orientation does not reflect
   current understanding of transgender as gender identity.^11,14 It is
   striking, therefore, that national surveys such as the NHIS and NATS,
   and state surveys such as the Illinois and Idaho BRFSS,^57,58 until
   recent years, have categorized transgender as a sexual orientation
   rather than a gender identity. This practice misrepresents the number
   of transgender people in the United States and sustains misconceptions
   about what it means to be transgender. Of note, as of 2015, the NHIS no
   longer lists transgender as an option under sexual orientation.

Strengths and Limitations

   Several considerations should be made when one is interpreting the
   results of our study. First, transgender people differ greatly and not
   all transgender individuals desire or have the resources to seek
   surgeries, hormone therapy, or change their name or sex designation on
   legal documents.^1 We believe that our analysis based on self-reported
   data provides a more accurate estimate of the number of transgender
   individuals than estimates based on characteristics that represent
   subsamples of the transgender population only (e.g., only those who
   seek surgery).

   Second, only about a quarter of the included surveys reported on the
   general population. More than half of the surveys on which our
   population-size estimate was based reported on younger adults (college
   and university students), and research has shown that individuals aged
   18 to 24 years are more likely to identify as transgender.^21 Also, the
   incarceration rate among transgender individuals is disproportionally
   high,^4 especially among transgender women, and as such they may be
   overrepresented in samples drawn from the inmate population, which
   represented 20% of respondents in our analyses. Both aspects may lead
   to higher population size estimates and may not generalize to US adults
   as a whole.

   Third, evidence from surveys that asked about sex assigned at birth
   suggested that the number of adults whose sex assigned at birth differs
   from their current gender identity could be as large as our current
   estimate of the transgender population size. As such, our analysis may
   not have captured all individuals who are considered transgender from a
   demographic perspective, but who do not identify explicitly with the
   term "transgender." How the sum of these factors that may have affected
   our estimate ultimately add up is a complex question that perhaps can
   be answered when more accurate general population data become
   available. Also, survey errors with respect to data recording, although
   they are expected to be small, may have affected our estimate,
   especially because the base rate of the transgender population is
   small.

   Lastly, our analysis indicated significant amounts of residual
   heterogeneity, which can potentially be explained by differences in
   respondent characteristics (e.g., general population, students,
   inmates) and the types of questions used to assess transgender
   identity.^59 For example, the 2015 wave of the NCHA asked about
   respondents' gender with 0.45% endorsing transgender, whereas
   respondents in the 2016 wave were asked whether they identified as
   transgender (1.8% responded yes). The small number of surveys in our
   analysis did not allow for testing more than 1 model predictor.

Conclusions

   We aimed to estimate the current transgender population size in the
   United States. On the basis of our analysis of national probability
   samples, 390 per 100 000 adults are estimated to be transgender in
   2016, but the evidence suggests that future surveys will likely observe
   higher numbers. Our analysis also found that surveys use a variety of
   questions to ask about transgender identity and may still miscategorize
   transgender as a sexual orientation. This categorization does not
   reflect current understanding of transgender as a gender identity, and
   we recommend using standardized questions to identify respondents with
   transgender and nonbinary gender identities in future population
   surveys. Best practices regarding questions that can be used for
   transgender-inclusive data collection have already been published.^13

     * Transgender Identity Terms and Labels

   Many people believe there are only two genders: man and woman. This is
   known as the gender binary. But that's not how every person experiences
   their own gender.

   If your gender is different from the "male" or "female" label on your
   original birth certificate, you may identify as transgender. If your
   gender doesn't fit into the gender binary, you may identify as
   nonbinary.

What's gender identity?

   Gender identity describes the inner experience of your own gender --
   whether you feel like a man, woman, genderqueer, agender, nonbinary, or
   another identity.

   Remember: There's no right or wrong way to look like a woman, man, or
   nonbinary person.

What does transgender mean?

   Transgender means your gender identity is different from the gender
   that the doctor gave you when you were born, based on the way your body
   looked. That label is called "sex assigned at birth" -- usually "male"
   or "female."

   Transgender people use different terms to describe themselves. Always
   use the language and labels that a person uses for themselves.

What does nonbinary mean?

   If your gender doesn't fit under the label of either "male" or
   "female," then you may identify as nonbinary. Your gender identity may
   be nonbinary if you're: both a man and a woman, in between, or totally
   outside those categories.

What does cisgender mean?

   If you have the same gender identity as the sex the doctor assigned you
   at birth, you're "cisgender" -- like a man who was assigned male at
   birth or a woman who was assigned female at birth.

What's gender expression?

   How someone expresses their gender identity is called gender
   expression.

   Like cisgender people, transgender people express their gender
   identities in different ways -- through dress, behavior, mannerisms,
   and more.

What's a gender modality?

   "Cisgender" and "transgender" are key gender modalities. Your gender
   modality describes whether your gender identity corresponds to your sex
   assigned at birth. For example, a cisgender woman's gender modality is
   "cisgender" and her gender identity is "woman."

   Transgender is both a gender identity and a gender modality. For
   example, a woman who was assigned male at birth may have a gender
   identity of "transgender woman" or "woman." Her gender modality may be
   "transgender" or "not cisgender."

What's gender dysphoria?

   Many trans and nonbinary people experience gender dysphoria. Gender
   dysphoria is distress, unhappiness, and anxiety related to the mismatch
   between your gender identity and important aspects of your body -- such
   as your genitals, voice, or chest. You also can have gender dysphoria
   if you're treated socially as the wrong gender, like when people use
   the wrong pronouns for you.

   While psychologists used to call gender dysphoria "gender identity
   disorder," being transgender and/or nonbinary isn't a mental illness.
   Challenges and distress can be common for trans and nonbinary folks
   because of transphobia (AKA transmisia) -- the ways that society treats
   transgender and nonbinary people as less than human.

   Not everyone experiences gender dysphoria. When they do, it can be
   different for each person. The same is true for gender euphoria.

What's gender euphoria?

   Gender euphoria is the joy, relief, or well-being that many transgender
   and nonbinary people feel in their gender identity. Gender euphoria
   might happen when someone feels harmony between their gender identity
   and their body and/or their gender expression. Gender euphoria also
   occurs when someone is treated socially in alignment with their gender
   identity, like when people use affirming gendered language. An example
   would be a trans woman feeling good when she's called "ma'am."

   Gender euphoria can be a benefit of transitioning -- making changes to
   live in harmony with your gender identity. Trans people use different
   kinds of transition to feel more like their gender identity.

Is transgender a sexual orientation?

   Nope! People often confuse gender identity, which is about who you are
   inside, with sexual orientation, which is about who you're attracted
   to. Sexual orientation -- like lesbian, gay, bisexual, and more --
   describes sexual or romantic attraction to different genders. Gender
   modality and gender identity are about what gender you are, not what
   gender you're attracted to.

   Just like transgender people can have any gender identity or gender
   expression, they can also have any sexual or romantic orientation.

What does passing mean?

   Passing means others see you as the gender that you identify as. For
   example, a transgender woman seen as a cisgender woman is "passing."

   Some transgender people feel that passing is important emotionally
   because it affirms their gender identity. They may experience passing
   as a positive thing that sparks gender euphoria.

   Other transgender people don't care about passing or don't want to "be
   read" as cisgender. For them, passing suggests transgender and
   nonbinary people have to look and sound like cisgender people for their
   gender identity to be "real." They may also see passing as accepting
   transphobia/transmisia -- that the only trans people who get to be safe
   are the ones who don't "look trans."

   Because of transphobia/transmisia, passing can provide safety from
   harassment and violence. Someone who passes is likely to have an easier
   time moving through the world than a person who's seen as transgender.
   This person has "passing privilege."

   No matter what a person "looks like," their gender identity is always
   valid and real.

Where can I get safe gender-affirming medical care?

   You deserve safe health care. To find an affordable trans-competent
   nurse or doctor, it can be helpful to do an internet search, ask trans
   and nonbinary people in your community, or talk to someone from a local
   LGBTQ+ community organization.

   Planned Parenthood health centers serve people of all genders. Anyone
   can visit their nearest Planned Parenthood health center for STD
   testing, birth control, physical exams, other sexual and reproductive
   health services, and referrals. Find your nearest Planned Parenthood
   health center and learn about the services it offers.

   Many Planned Parenthood health centers are able to offer
   gender-affirming hormone treatment (sometimes called GAHT). The best
   way to learn about the services available in your area is to contact
   your nearest Planned Parenthood health center.

   If your closest Planned Parenthood health center doesn't offer
   gender-affirming hormone treatments, and you want them to, you can tell
   them. Hearing from patients helps your nearest Planned Parenthood add
   services that you need. They may be able to recommend a trans-friendly
   doctor in your area who provides the services you need.

WELCOME!

   WELCOME!

   TransAmsterdam is a trans organization for art, culture, and lifestyle.
   Our goal is to increase the visibility of transgender, including
   non-binary, people and improve their image through art and culture. Are
   you an artist and do you want to share or develop your talents? Or
   would you like to meet other people in and surrounding the transgender
   community? Then TransAmsterdam is the organization for you!


   With art and culture, we aim to show that trans people are more than
   their gender. By doing so, we connect the trans community to the rest
   of society and increase the emancipation and empowerment of transgender
   people in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and beyond.


   To showcase trans people's creativity, we work together with a diverse
   array of artists, such as photographers, actors, poets, musicians,
   writers, filmmakers, and painters. Besides that, we also collaborate
   with national and international art and cultural organizations. In
   2019, we founded the Trans Art School, where trans people can take part
   in art, cultural and lifestyle workshops.


   Interested? See which activities and events we have planned on our
   website and social media. Or would you like to collaborate with or
   volunteer for us? Then email us at info@transamsterdam.nl.


   WHAT DO WE OFER TO IMPROVE THE VISIBILITY AND IMAGE OF TRANSGENDER
   PEOPLE?


     * We organize events for and by transgender, including non-binary,
       people and trans artists


     * We organize workshops and themed meetings at our Trans Art School.


     * We offer trans artists a platform and stage to showcase their art
       and culture.


     * We organize several events, including Trans and Friends Café
       InClusion, the yearly TransWalk, the Trans Stage at Pride Oost,
       Transgender Day of Visibility and Transgender Flag Day.


     * We act as a conversational partner between, on the one hand, our
       target audience and volunteers, and on the other hand, art,
       cultural and other organizations and institutions.


     * We acquire funds and subsidies that contribute to the realization
       of our goal.


     * We distribute information about transgender people and about art,
       culture and lifestyle.

Become a Partner in Pride

Support LGBTIQ community organizations working for justice and equality

   Leaders of LGBTIQ organizations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and
   Democratic Republic of Congo work and live in environments
   characterized by violent homophobia, legally entrenched discrimination,
   and political and social persecution. These human rights defenders put
   their safety on the line every day to lead organizations that stand up
   for the human rights and health of LGBTIQ communities. Far too often,
   they are doing it alone.

   You can be a part of changing that. Help us get LGBTIQ organizations
   the funds they need.

   The SLF's Partners in Pride campaign supports these organizations,
   which are lifelines for their communities. They provide vital services,
   including health care, mental health supports, social supports, and
   legal counsel.
   Donate Now

   The last year has been a difficult one for our LGBTIQ partner
   organizations. Widespread discrimination, pervasive stigma, and
   barriers to social and legal support have led to human rights
   violations and exacerbated the impacts of HIV on LGBTIQ communities.
   Yet, our LGBTIQ partners continue to provide life-saving programs and
   to fight for the right to exist free from stigma, discrimination, and
   criminalization.

   "We are driven by the conviction that we are part of a larger story of
   global human rights, and we will not give up until we have built the
   future we deserve." - Frank Mugisha

   (FARUG). Biggie is a social justice warrior and activist who is
   unapologetic about her work with the LGBTIQ community, standing up to
   stigma and discrimination often imposed by politicians and religious
   leaders who cling to colonial-era, anti-LGBTIQ laws that encourage
   hatred and curtail human rights.

   violence against community members. Photo provided by HAPA-Kenya.
   Outreach and community engagement are central to defending human

Who are Transgender People ? The Basics

   Publié le 10 février 2010 - modifié le 17 février 2010

   Transgender is an "umbrella" term used to describe a wide range of
   identities and experiences, and is used to refer to many types of
   people, including transsexual people ; crossdressers ; androgynous
   people ; genderqueers ; and other gender non-conforming people whose
   appearance or characteristics are perceived to be gender atypical.

   In its broadest sense, "transgender" encompasses anyone whose identity
   or behavior falls outside stereotypical gender expectations.
   It is important to understand that some people may identify as
   transgender but not fall into one of the subcategories discussed here.
   This publication attempts to identify many of the ways in which
   transgender individuals identify and express themselves, but this
   listing is in no way complete. Furthermore, it is particularly
   important to realize that many individuals, despite the fact that they
   may appear transgender to some, do not consider themselves to be
   transgender. It is important that we not label people transgender based
   on our perceptions, but instead use the words they use to describe
   themselves.
   All people have a gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person's
   internal sense of being male, female or something else. For most
   people, one's gender identity matches the sex assigned to them at
   birth--for example, a person born female typically identifies as a
   girl, and later, as a woman. For many transgender people, there may not
   be a match.

   All people also have a gender expression. Gender expression refers to
   all of the ways that people express their gender (or gender identity)
   to the outside world, including through dress, appearance, and
   behavior. For many transgender people, their gender expression doesn't
   match what society thinks it should be.

10 TRANSITIONING OUR SHELTERS, SOME DEFINITIONS

   Transgender : An "umbrella" term for people whose gender identity,
   expression or behavior is different from those typically associated
   with their assigned sex at birth, including but not limited to
   transsexuals, crossdressers, androgynous people, genderqueers, and
   gender non-conforming people. Transgender is a broad term and is good
   for providers to use.

   Transgender Man : A term for a transgender individual who currently
   identifies as a man (see also "FTM").

   Transgender Woman : A term for a transgender individual who currently
   identifies as a woman (see also "MTF").

   Gender Identity : An individual's internal sense of being male, female,
   or something else. Since gender identity is internal, one's gender
   identity is not necessarily visible to others.

   Gender Expression : How a person represents or expresses one's gender
   identity to others, often through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, voice
   or body characteristics.

   Transsexual : A term for people whose gender identity is different from
   their assigned sex at birth. Often, but not always, transsexual people
   alter their bodies through hormones or surgery in order to make it
   match
   their gender identity.

   Cross-dresser : A term for people who dress in clothing traditionally
   or stereotypically worn by the other sex, but who generally have no
   intent to live full-time as the other gender.

   Transvestite : A term for a cross-dresser that is considered derogatory
   by many.

   Genderqueer : A term used by some individuals who identify as neither
   entirely male nor entirely female.

   Genderqueer is an identity more common among young people.

   Gender Non-conforming : A term for individuals whose gender expression
   is different from the societal expectations based on their assigned sex
   at birth.

   Bi-gendered : One who has a significant gender identity that
   encompasses both genders, male and female. Some may feel that one side
   or the other is stronger, but both sides are there.

   Two-spirit : The definition of a two-spirit person varies across the
   Native American cultures in which they appear. In general, two-spirit
   people are born one sex, and end up fulfilling the roles assigned to
   both sexes, or other roles reserved for two-spirit people. Some people
   consider two-spirit a term that can refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual and
   transgender people, while others think it is best used only for
   transgender people.

   FTM : A person who has transitioned from "female-to-male," meaning a
   person who was assigned female at birth, but now identifies and lives
   as a male. Also known as a "transgender man."

   MTF : A person who has transitioned from "male-to-female," meaning a
   person who was assigned male at birth, but now identifies and lives as
   a female. Also known as a "transgender woman."

   Passing : A term used by transgender people to mean that they are seen
   as the gender they self-identify as. For example, a transgender man
   (born female) who most people see as a man.

   Sex Reassignment Surgery : Surgical procedures that change one's body
   to make it conform to a person's gender identity. This may include "top
   surgery" (breast augmentation or removal) or "bottom surgery" (altering
   genitals). Contrary to popular belief, there is not one surgery ; in
   fact there are many different surgeries. "Sex change surgery" is
   considered a derogatory term by many.

   Sexual Orientation : A term describing a person's attraction to members
   of the same sex or different sex. Usually defined as lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, or heterosexual.

   Transition : The period during which a person begins to live as their
   new gender. Transitioning may include changing one's name, taking
   hormones, having surgery, or changing legal documents (e.g. driver's
   license,
   Social Security number, birth certificate) to reflect their new gender.

   Intersex : A term used for people who are born with external genitalia,
   chromosomes, or internal reproductive systems that are not
   traditionally associated with either a "standard" male or female.

   Drag Queen : generally used to accurately refer to men who dress as
   women (often celebrity women) for the purpose of entertaining others at
   bars, clubs, or other events. It is also used as slang, sometimes in a
   derogatory manner, to refer to all transgender women.

   Drag King : used to refer to women who dress as men for the purpose of
   entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events.

   These definitions are influenced by a variety of sources. See Patrick
   Letellier, Beyond He and She : A Transgender News Profile (January
   2003), Good Times ; Intersex Society of North America, www.isna.org the
   Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,

Glossary of Terms Related to Transgender Communities

   Main content start

   Terminology frequently morphs within LGBTQIA communities, and a word
   that means one thing in one community may mean something else in
   another community. The terms used here are commonly used in the
   Stanford LGBTQIA community.
   2023-24 Neighborhood Decorative Accent Line

Basic Definitions

     * Assigned Female At Birth (AFAB) or Female-Assigned-at-Birth (FAAB):
       An individual assigned female at birth.
     * Assigned Male At Birth (AMAB) or Male-Assigned-at-Birth (MAAB): An
       individual assigned male at birth.
     * Assigned Sex or Sex Assigned At Birth: The sex (typically M or F)
       that is assigned to a person based on external genitalia at birth.
     * Cisgender, Cis: Someone whose gender identity corresponds with
       expectations based on the sex they were assigned at birth. For
       example, a person who was assigned female at birth and identifies
       as a woman is regarded as cisgender or as a cisgender woman.
     * Gender-Affirming Surgery: Any surgical procedure that aims to
       increase a sense of congruence with one's gender identity and
       physical body. Gender-affirming surgeries may include: chest
       reconstructive surgeries (e.g., double mastectomy, feminizing
       mammoplasty), genital reconstructive surgeries (e.g., orchiectomy,
       vaginoplasty, metoidioplasty, phalloplasty), facial feminization
       surgeries (e.g., tracheal shave, rhinoplasty, brow lift), or other
       procedures (e.g., vocal cord surgery). In California, surgery is
       not required to change one's legal gender marker. Note: This term
       is preferred over the outdated term Sexual Reassignment Surgery
       (SRS). It is also preferred over the term gender confirmation
       surgery (GCS) because gender cannot be "confirmed" by having
       surgery. A person's gender is to be respected regardless of
       surgical history/status or what kind of genitals they have or had.
       It is best to avoid terms such as "pre-op", "non-op", or "post-op,"
       as they reinforce the assumption all trans people want to or will
       have the opportunity to have surgery.
     * Gender Dysphoria: Emotional distress related to the sense that
       one's assigned sex is not in line with one's gender identity.
       Gender Dysphoria is also a medical and mental health diagnosis that
       may warrant treatment in the form of gender-affirming medical
       interventions.
     * Gender Expression: The ways in which a person outwardly expresses
       their gender, often through hair, makeup, clothing, and other
       aspects of appearance. Gender expression does not always correspond
       to gender identity.
     * Gender Identity: The inherent feeling within an individual of what
       gender they are; a person may identify as a man, woman, neither,
       in-between, both, or fluidly moving between these two binary
       categories.
     * Gender-Neutral Pronouns: Pronouns that a person may use when they
       do not fully identify with binary gender categories. Examples of
       gender-neutral pronouns include singular they/them/their,
       ey/em/eir, zie/hir/hirs, or no pronouns. It's best to ask what
       pronouns are appropriate for them.
     * Genderqueer: A gender identity that denotes someone who does not
       fully identify with the binary genders of male/man/masculine or
       female/woman/feminine. A genderqueer person may identify as neither
       a man nor a woman, in-between, both, fluidly moving between these
       two categories, or as a third/alternate gender. Related to the
       term nonbinary, which has become more popular in the 2010's.
     * Intersex: A general term used for a variety of conditions in which
       a person is born with a physical characteristics (e.g., gonads,
       chromosomal makeup, external genitalia, internal reproductive or
       urinary organs) that do not fit typical medical or social
       definitions of female or male. Some people use the term DSD
       (Disorders of Sex Development) to describe intersex people, but
       this is not seen as affirming by intersex communities.
     * Nonbinary: A gender identity that denotes someone who does not
       fully identify with the binary genders of male/man/masculine or
       female/woman/feminine. A nonbinary person may identify as neither a
       man nor a woman, in-between, both, fluidly moving between these two
       categories, or as a third/alternate gender. Related to the
       term genderqueer, which was used more often prior to the 2010's.
     * Passing: Being perceived as cisgender or as a gender in line with
       one's gender identity. This term is not considered affirming to
       many, as it implies that trans people are deceptive or are not
       truly the gender they say they are. Passing is important to some
       people (e.g., for safety reasons), but it is not the goal of every
       trans person.
     * Queer: Used to describe non-normative identities (both sexual
       identities and gender identities) that might not easily be
       classified under other terminology (gay, lesbian, etc.). Queer can
       also be used as an umbrella term to describe LGBTQIA identities as
       a whole. In many communities, the term "queer" also has a political
       connotation that is connected to LGBTQIA activism. The term queer
       may be offensive to older LGBTQIA individuals, so it is best to use
       caution and only use this term when you know that someone uses it
       as an affirming term to describe themselves.
     * Sexual Orientation: A way to describe a person's romantic and/or
       sexual attractions to others. Sexual orientation may consist of
       attraction, behavior, and identity, and not all of these factors
       need to be aligned/consistent. For example, a person may have
       attractions towards trans women, be sexually active with cisgender
       men, and have an identity as heterosexual. Some labels to describe
       sexual orientation include: heterosexual, straight, lesbian, gay,
       bisexual, pansexual, queer, or fluid.
     * Transgender, Trans: An adjective to describe someone who does not
       fully identify with the sex they were assigned at birth. These
       terms are often used as umbrella terms for more specific terms that
       people within trans communities use to describe themselves (and
       sometimes a person may use several to describe themselves). Some of
       these terms include:
          + Man
          + Woman
          + Transgender man, trans man, trans masculine
          + Transgender woman, trans woman, trans feminine
          + Genderqueer
          + Bigender
          + Gender neutral
          + Demi-boy
          + Demi-girl
          + Agender
          + Genderless
          + Neutrois
          + Pangender
          + It's best to ask how a transgender person identifies. Be aware
            that the word "tranny" is considered offensive.
     * Transgender Man, Trans Man, Trans Masculine: Someone who was female
       assigned at birth who identifies as a man or on the masculine
       spectrum. Note: The term FTM is no longer considered affirming.
     * Transgender Woman, Trans Woman, Trans Feminine: Someone who was
       male assigned at birth who identifies as a woman or on the feminine
       spectrum. Note: The term MTF is no longer considered affirming.
     * Transition: The process of shifting one's gender identity and/or
       expression. Transition is a process that occurs over time, varies
       greatly among individuals, and may consist of physical/medical,
       emotional, social, and legal components. There is no uniform or set
       path for how a person transitions, if at all. Some transgender
       people consider themselves post-transition, and some no longer
       consider themselves to be transgender. Others feel that they are in
       a state of transition for the rest of their lives.
     * Transsexual: A term that was commonly used before the term
       "transgender" came into more popular usage in the 1990's. Some
       people still identify as transsexual, but this term is no longer
       considered affirming.

Transgender Student-Athlete Participation Policy

   Updated 4/17/2023 to provide increased clarity

   At its January 19, 2022 meeting, the NCAA Board of Governors updated
   the transgender student-athlete participation policy governing college
   sports.

   The new policy aligns transgender student-athlete participation with
   the Olympic Movement. The resulting sport-by-sport approach preserves
   opportunity for transgender student-athletes while balancing fairness,
   inclusion and safety for all who compete.

   Like the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, the updated NCAA policy
   calls for transgender student-athlete participation for each sport to
   be determined by the policy for the national governing body of that
   sport. If there is no NGB policy for a sport, it would then be
   determined by the policy for that sport's international federation. If
   there is no international federation policy, it would be determined
   by policy criteria previously established by the International Olympic
   Committee. Sport-specific polices are subject to ongoing review and
   recommendation by the NCAA Committee on Competitive Safeguards and
   Medical Aspects of Sports to the Board of Governors.

   The policy is effective immediately, with three phases of
   implementation.

Phase One - 2022 winter and spring championships

   For participation in 2022 winter and spring championships, transgender
   student-athletes were required to provide documentation to the CSMAS
   within four weeks before the selections date for their championship.

   The documentation had to demonstrate compliance with the 2010 NCAA
   policy, which calls for one year of testosterone suppression treatment.
   It also had to document a one-time serum testosterone level that fell
   below the maximum allowable level for the sport in which the
   student-athlete was competing within four weeks of championship
   selections for that sport. That means that student-athletes who already
   fulfilled the 2010 NCAA policy only needed provide one validated serum
   testosterone level.

   Transgender student-athletes who participated in regular season
   competition (including conference championships) remained subject to
   the 2010 NCAA policy only.

Phase Two - 2022-23 and 2023-24 regular season and championships

   Beginning Aug. 1, 2022, participation in NCAA sports requires
   transgender student-athletes to provide documentation that meets the
   above criteria for the 2010 NCAA policy, plus meet the sport standard
   for documented testosterone levels at three points in time: 1. Prior to
   any competition during the regular season; 2. Prior to the first
   competition in an NCAA championship event; and 3. Prior to any
   competition in the non-championship segment. See the transgender
   student-athlete eligibility review procedures for more information.

Phase Three - 2024-25 full implementation

   Beginning Aug. 1, 2024, participation in NCAA sports requires
   transgender student-athletes to provide documentation no less than
   twice annually (and at least once within four weeks of competition in
   NCAA championships) that meets the sport-specific standard (which may
   include testosterone levels, mitigation timelines and other aspects of
   sport-governing body policies) as reviewed and approved by CSMAS. More
   information about the specific application of Phase Three will be
   provided prior to implementation.

Additional flexibility

   The Board of Governors urged the divisions to allow for additional,
   future eligibility if a transgender student-athlete loses eligibility
   based on the policy change, provided they meet the newly adopted
   standards.

   The NCAA's Office of Inclusion and Sport Science Institute also
   released the Gender Identity and Student-Athlete Participation Summit
   Final Report. The report assists ongoing membership efforts to support
   an inclusive environment that promotes and develops the mental and
   physical health of transgender and non-binary student-athletes in
   collegiate sport. The foundational principles in this report will be
   developed further in conjunction with the Committee to Promote Cultural
   Diversity and Equity, CSMAS and other core membership committees that
   address gender identity.

Gender Equality Index 2023: Towards a green transition in transport and

            The Gender Equality Index 2023 presents the EU in relation to
            gender equality amid crises and uncertainties. In recent
            years, the world has been hit by repeated shocks and multiple
            crises. What remains constant is the fact that when crisis
            strikes, women and girls suffer disproportionally. The crises

Gender-sensitive communication
            This toolkit provides guidelines for the use of
            gender-sensitive language in writing. Gender-sensitive
            communication ensures that women and men - and those who do
            not conform to the binary gender system - are treated as
            persons of equal importance and dignity.

GRPP: Four letters can unlock EUR2 trillion to accelerate our drive towards
gender equality
            Each year the EU spends 14% of its Gross Domestic Product
            (GDP) on public works, from building projects to social
            infrastructure. Smart targeting of that EUR2 trillion in
            public funds and considering how it impacts the lives of both
            women and men is the essence of Gender-responsive public
            procurement, or GRPP.

   What does it mean?

   The National Center for Transgender Equality defines transgender people
   as those who have a different gender identity to their assigned gender
   at birth. Some people may also use "trans" as a shortened version for
   transgender.

   Gender identity is the innate knowledge of who a person is. Every
   person has a gender identity, which may match their assigned sex at
   birth, or it may be different.

   A healthcare professional usually assigns newborns either a male or
   female sex at birth. If people identify with a different gender to the
   one they were assigned, they may describe themselves as transgender.

   A transgender woman is someone who is currently living as a woman but
   was assigned a male sex at birth. A transgender man is someone who is
   currently living as a man but was assigned a female sex at birth.

   Some transgender people may not identify with being either male or
   female, or may identify as a combination of male and female. Other
   terms people may use to describe their gender identity include
   nonbinary or genderqueer.

   How would a person know if they are transgender?

   People may realize they are transgender at any age. Planned Parenthood
   notes that many people know they are transgender from a young age, and
   others may not realize until later in life.

   People may have a feeling of not fitting in, or may feel uncomfortable
   emotions when talking about their gender or being seen by others as a
   gender they do not identify with.

   A person can try the following to help them understand their gender
   identity:
     * Write about how they feel in a journal on a regular basis.
     * Talk about their feelings with people they trust.
     * Talk about their feelings with a therapist or counselor.

   A person can also try to learn about other transgender people's
   experiences. They can do this through reading literature written by
   transgender people or meeting transgender people in person.

   It may be possible to find helpful LGBTQIA+ resources and support
   groups either in the community or at school or university.

   Transgender and gender dysphoria

   Some transgender people may experience severe emotional distress if
   there is a difference between their gender identity and assigned sex at
   birth. The medical term for this is gender dysphoria.

   Gender dysphoria can affect a person's health, well-being, and everyday
   life. By aligning with and expressing their gender identity, people may
   be able to resolve gender dysphoria.

   The American Psychiatric Association notes that gender dysphoria often
   begins in childhood. However, some people may not experience it until
   puberty or later in life.

   What to know about transitioning

   Transitioning is the term people use for the period of time when they
   align themselves and their life with their true gender identity, rather
   than their assigned sex at birth.

   Transitioning is not necessary to be transgender, although many
   transgender people choose to transition at some point.

   There are no set steps or criteria for transitioning, and it is
   individual for each person.

   Steps some people may or may not take to transition can include:
     * changing their appearance, such as clothing and hairstyle
     * changing their name
     * changing pronouns
     * changing official documents to reflect their gender identity
     * hormone therapy to change physical characteristics
     * medical procedures to change physical characteristics

   Some people may also decide to take puberty blockers. For some, the
   changes that occur during puberty do not align with their gender
   identity.

   These block the hormones that lead to puberty, which stops periods,
   breast growth, facial hair growth, and voice-deepening.

   According to the Gender Identity Development Service, hormone blockers
   only last for as long as a person is taking the medication. If a person
   stops taking them and providing that no other interventions have
   occurred, they will go through puberty.

Gender-affirming hormones

   Some transgender people may choose to take gender-affirming hormones.
   These are hormones that create physical changes in the body to align
   with a person's gender identity.

   People may take testosterone to develop masculine characteristics or
   estrogen to develop feminine characteristics.

Gender-affirming surgery

   Some transgender people may choose to have gender-affirming surgery.
   People may choose to have surgery that alters their face, chest, or
   anatomy to align with their gender identity.

       effects?
     * What to know about female-to-male surgery
     * Tips for presenting more feminine without hormones
     * Tips on transitioning and presenting as more feminine later in life

   Accessing healthcare as a transgender individual

   People may want to search for healthcare professionals and clinics
   where staff are trans-friendly and have appropriate training and
   knowledge in transgender issues.

   People can find local providers in their state or city through the
   Centers for Control and Disease Prevention (CDC) list of resources.

   The following organizations also provide helpful information and
   resources:
     * World Professional Association for Transgender Health
     * Fenway Health
     * Whitman-Walker Health

   GLAAD also provides a list of community resources here.

   What is the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity?

   Sexual orientation differs from gender identity. Sexual orientation
   focuses on who people are attracted to. People of any gender identity
   can have any sexual orientation.

   Learn more about different types of sexual orientations here.

   Gender identity is a person's innate knowledge of their gender. People
   may identify as a man, woman, nonbinary person, or another gender
   identity.

   Learn more about different types of gender identities here.

   What is the difference between transgender and intersex?

   The Intersex Society of North America defines intersex as "a general
   term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a
   reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't seem to fit the typical
   definitions of female or male."

   Sex chromosomes determine the biological sex of a baby. Intersex people
   may have chromosomes typical to a male or female but have no internal
   or external anatomy that corresponds to biological male or female
   anatomy.

   Transgender people are usually born with genetics and anatomy that
   match a biological definition of male or female. Transgender people may
   feel they have a different gender identity to their assigned sex at
   birth.

   Learn more about what it means to be intersex here.

   What is the difference between transgender and gender nonconforming?

   A person who is gender nonconforming does not conform to the
   stereotypical ideas of gender.

   The LGBTQIA Resource Center notes that people more commonly use the
   term to refer to gender expression instead of gender identity.

   People may choose to appear and behave in ways that are more
   "masculine" or "feminine" than society may stereotypically associate
   with their gender.

   Someone who is gender nonconforming may or may not be transgender.
   Transgender people may be gender nonconforming or they may conform to
   the gender stereotypes of the gender they identify with.

   Transgender and nonbinary

   People may describe themselves as nonbinary if they do not identify
   with either a male or female gender. Nonbinary people may not feel they
   fit into the gender binary of being a man or a woman. People may also
   use the term genderqueer to describe their gender identity.

   Nonbinary people may identify with elements of being both male and
   female, a different gender, or no gender. Some people may have a fluid
   gender that changes over time.

   Transgender people may be nonbinary, but many transgender people
   identify as either a man or a woman.

   Learn more about being nonbinary here.

   Being an ally

   Being an ally to transgender people can help create a safer and better
   society for transgender people, and people of all gender identities.

   Action steps as an ally can include:
     * respecting a transgender person's gender identity and use of
       pronouns
     * avoiding referring to a person's birth name or assigned sex at
       birth, if a person has changed their name
     * avoiding making any assumptions about transgender people, such as
       their sexual orientation
     * using inclusive language that avoids gender, such as "person"
       instead of "man" or "woman" in group settings
     * supporting the use of all-gender public restrooms
     * respecting that it is up to a transgender person to share their
       gender history or not, and avoiding "outing" a transgender person
     * listening to transgender people and learning about their
       experiences
     * supporting campaigns for transgender equality

   Pronoun usage

   People can make sure always to use the pronouns a transgender person
   wants them to use. If people are unsure which pronouns a person uses,
   make introductions using preferred pronouns and ask the other person
   theirs.

   If appropriate, people can also ask which terms a person wants others
   to use to describe their gender identity. Many transgender people may
   identify as a man or a woman.

   Learn more about gender pronouns here.

   Terminology to avoid

   Certain words or phrases can be very disrespectful or offensive to
   transgender people.

   According to GLAAD, terminology to avoid includes:
   Terminology to avoid Preferred terminology Reason
   a transgender or transgenders transgender people or a transgender
   person Transgender is an adjective, not a noun.
   transgendered transgender Adding "-ed" adds confusion and is
   grammatically incorrect.
   transgenderism being transgender Anti-transgender activists use the
   term "transgenderism" to dehumanize transgender people.
   sex change, pre-operative, or postoperative transition Using these
   terms implies that a person must have surgery to be transgender.
   sex change surgery or sex reassignment gender-affirming surgery With
   surgery, the person is not changing their sex, but altering their body
   to better match their gender.
   o biologically or genetically male or female
   o born a man or woman o assigned or designated male at birth
   o assigned or designated female at birth A number of factors determine
   a person's sex. These terms oversimplify a complex subject.
   passing or stealth o visibly transgender
   o not visibly transgender The terms imply that transgender people are
   deceiving.

   Other terminology to avoid includes:
     * he-she
     * she-male
     * gender-bender
     * trannie or tranny
     * any word that implies masquerading or pretending, or "passing" as a
       man or woman

   People should also not ask questions about surgery, anatomy, or sex
   life.

   Summary

   The term transgender refers to those who do not identify with the sex
   they were assigned at birth. A person can realize they are transgender
   at any point in life.

   Transitioning is a term people use to refer to the steps a person can
   take to align themselves with their true gender identity. This can
   involve changing their pronouns, taking gender-affirming hormones, and
   undergoing gender-affirming surgery.

   However, transitioning is not necessary to be transgender.

   To be an ally, people can use correct pronouns and avoid using
   offensive terminology. They can also support appropriate campaigns and
   listen to transgender people's experiences.

Introduction and summary

   Author's note: "Transgender" is an umbrella term used to describe
   people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differ based on
   the sex they were assigned at birth.^1 The transgender community is not
   a monolith. Transgender people have diverse sexual orientations, gender
   expressions, and gender identities, and transgender identities do not
   depend on physical appearance or medical procedures.

   Discrimination, stigma, and violence, along with other social,
   political, and economic factors, significantly affect the physical,
   mental, and behavioral health of transgender adults.^2 Research
   demonstrates that, compared with the general population, transgender
   people suffer from more chronic health conditions and experience higher
   rates of health problems related to HIV/AIDS, substance use, mental
   illness, and sexual and physical violence, as well as higher prevalence
   and earlier onset of disabilities that can also lead to health
   issues.^3 In addition to poorer health outcomes, transgender people
   also encounter unique challenges and inequalities in their ability to
   access health insurance and adequate care.^4 The public health and
   economic crises spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic have only exacerbated
   existing disparities and barriers to care for transgender people,
   especially transgender people of color.^5

   While robust laws that protect transgender people from discrimination
   based on gender identity are essential to providing greater legal
   safeguards, such tools must be paired with enforcement mechanisms and
   in-practice policies that are affirming, inclusive, and culturally
   competent. Adopting both nondiscrimination laws and inclusive policies
   will be critical for improving health outcomes and the daily lives of
   the estimated 1.4 million^6 adults identifying as transgender in the
   United States.

   To examine the health conditions that transgender adults face, this
   report incorporates storytelling to elevate their lived experiences.
   The following sections highlight:
     * The status of the physical, behavioral, and mental health of
       transgender communities and barriers to accessing general and
       gender-affirming care
     * The contemporary landscape of legal and regulatory
       nondiscrimination protections in health care
     * In-practice policies to promote affirming, inclusive, and
       culturally competent care

Health status of and barriers to care for transgender communities

   Transgender individuals are a high-risk population for mental and
   physical health problems and are consistently and systemically
   underserved by the American medical system.^7 Regular harassment and
   discrimination contribute to high rates of stress and--combined with
   adverse social, political, and economic risk factors--make transgender
   individuals significantly more likely to experience poor health
   outcomes. Structural, institutional, and individual barriers in access
   to care, along with a lack of cultural competency from many health care
   providers, contribute to the large disparities in health between
   transgender and cisgender populations.

   For example, according to 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   System (BRFSS) data, 3 in 5 transgender respondents report experiencing
   poor mental health at least one day in the past month--a rate 23
   percentage points higher than that of cisgender respondents. (see
   Figure 1) Fifty-four percent report poor physical health at least one
   day in the past month--a rate 18 percentage points higher than that of
   cisgender respondents. Transgender populations also face an increased
   likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease^8 as well as a higher
   likelihood of having asthma,^9 and their rates of chronic depression
   are more than twice that of cisgender populations.^10 Transgender
   respondents are significantly more likely to be living with HIV.^11 New
   research from the Williams Institute at the University of California,
   Los Angeles School of Law on the first transgender population-based
   national dataset developed through the TransPop study shows that 7
   percent^12 of transgender respondents have at some point been told by a
   doctor that they have a sexually transmitted infection (STI), compared
   with 2 percent of heterosexual cisgender respondents. (see Appendix A
   for more details)

   Figure 1

   IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gdL5J

   Figure 2

   IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/I1p5H

   The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated these existing disparities.
   Elevated rates of asthma, regular smoking, and HIV among transgender
   populations make them more prone than the general population to
   experience a severe case of COVID-19.^13 For example, CAP analysis of
   2019 BRFSS data shows that 22 percent of transgender individuals have
   been told they have asthma, compared with 14 percent of cisgender
   individuals. One international survey of transgender individuals during
   the pandemic found that 50 percent of respondents had risk factors for
   a severe course of a COVID-19 infection.^14 Evidence demonstrates that
   the economic and social inequalities felt by transgender individuals
   also make them less able to access quality care^15 and more likely to
   encounter the coronavirus due to factors such as overrepresentation in
   industries highly affected by the pandemic, such as restaurants and
   food services; hospitals; K-12 education; colleges and universities;
   and retail.^16 Isolation during the pandemic has also been particularly
   damaging to the mental health of transgender populations, who already
   face higher rates of mental health disparities,^17 and 1 in 3 reported
   having suicidal thoughts during the pandemic.^18 One in 2 reported that
   their access to gender-affirming health care was curtailed
   significantly during the pandemic,^19 and this reduced access to
   necessary care has also been detrimental to mental health.^20

Health effects of minority stress

   High rates of mental and physical health conditions among transgender
   people^21 can be partly explained under a "minority stress" model, a
   well-supported theory^22 that for minorities within a society, stigma,
   prejudice, and discrimination create a hostile and stressful social
   environment that can contribute to mental health problems such as
   depression and anxiety and drive higher prevalence of unhealthy
   or high-risk behaviors.^23 According to a nationally representative
   survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and
   other sexual and gender-diverse individuals (LGBTQI+) conducted by the
   Center for American Progress,^24 2 in 3 transgender individuals have
   experienced some form of discrimination in the year prior, including 65
   percent of transgender people of color.^25 The 2015 U.S. Transgender
   Survey, conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality,
   found that 46 percent of transgender individuals reported verbal
   harassment due to their gender identity in the past year,^26 while
   nearly 1 in 10 reported being physically attacked in the past year.
   Both numbers increase significantly for Black, Middle Eastern, and
   American Indian transgender populations.^27

   TransPop data^28 show extensive discrimination in the day-to-day lives
   of transgender respondents. Thirty-eight percent of transgender
   respondents reported that they were often or sometimes called names or
   insulted in the past year,^29 compared with 14 percent of cisgender
   heterosexual respondents. (see Figure 3) Twenty-eight percent ^30 also
   reported that they were often or sometimes threatened or harassed,
   compared with 10 percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. These
   experiences were compounded by disproportionately high rates of
   mistreatment and disrespect from others: 35 percent reported often or
   sometimes receiving poorer service at restaurants or stores, and 63
   percent reported that people sometimes or often acted as though they
   were better than them,^31 compared with 15 percent and 37 percent of
   cisgender heterosexual respondents, respectively.

   Figure 3

   IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vBsRc

   On a psychological level, stress from such experiences leads to the
   dysregulation of cortisol, which affects a wide range of bodily
   functions, including one's metabolism, mood, cardiovascular health, and
   immune system health.^32 Experiences of discrimination have been linked
   to high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder,^33 lack of body
   satisfaction,^34 depression,^35 anxiety, and psychological distress.^36
   Most alarmingly, such experiences have been connected to both
   nonsuicidal self-injury^37 and attempted suicide: 42 percent of
   transgender individuals reported attempting suicide to cope with
   transgender-related discrimination.^38 Data from the TransPop survey
   reveal disparities in suicidal behavior between transgender and
   cisgender heterosexual individuals in terms of contemplating suicide
   during their lifetime (81 percent^39 versus 30 percent); attempting
   suicide in their lifetime (42 percent^40 versus 8 percent); and
   engaging in nonsuicidal self-injury (56 percent^41 versus 9 percent).
   (see Figure 4)

   Figure 4

   IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2KAoz

   In addition to physical ailments and psychological harms, experiences
   of discrimination have been extensively linked to high rates of
   substance use. Transgender individuals who report experiencing high
   levels of discrimination are 3.59 times more likely to engage in binge
   drinking^42 than transgender individuals who report low levels of
   discrimination.^43 CAP analysis of data from the BRFSS shows that 59
   percent of transgender individuals report smoking tobacco some days or
   every day, compared with 39 percent of cisgender individuals.^44 (see
   Figure 5) TransPop data also show large disparities in drug use: 25
   percent of transgender respondents report using drugs other than
   alcohol at least twice a month, compared with 10 percent of cisgender
   heterosexual respondents. Discriminatory experiences have also been
   linked to difficulty engaging in healthy life practices, which is
   compounded by economic difficulties.^45 BRFSS data reveal that
   transgender adults reported exercising in the past month at a rate of 8
   percent lower than cisgender respondents; were 9 percent less likely to
   consume at least one fruit a day; and were 11 percent less likely to
   consume at least one vegetable a day. (see Figure 6)

Gender-based violence and hate violence

   The threat or presence of violence represents an additional determinant
   of health for many transgender people. In addition to causing physical
   injuries, the presence of violence against transgender people in many
   environments contributes to minority stress and mental health
   consequences.

   Lethal violence is widespread, and reported killings are increasing
   annually: In the United States, 29 transgender or gender-nonconforming
   people have been reported killed in 2021 so far, and 44 were killed in
   2020.^46 The true number is likely higher, as law enforcement and media
   often do not accurately identify victims.^47 Black and Latina
   transgender women are consistently and drastically overrepresented
   among victims. Awareness and fear of potential victimization contribute
   to the many stresses that transgender people already face. This fear is
   justified by not only the possibility of lethal violence but also the
   ubiquity of nonlethal violence. The TransPop survey found that 48
   percent of transgender adults in the United States have been beaten,
   physically attacked, or sexually assaulted at least once since the age
   of 18^48--a rate 12 percentage points higher than that of cisgender
   heterosexual people. (see Figure 7) Nearly half of those transgender
   respondents experienced such violence three or more times. Sixty-one
   percent of transgender people reported being threatened with violence,
   and 76 percent reported verbal insults or abuse.^49

   Violence takes many forms. According to the TransPop survey, 32 percent
   of transgender people report experiencing intimate partner violence,^50
   a rate 7 percentage points higher than that of cisgender heterosexual
   people. Among cases of transgender women killed in the U.S. between
   2015 and 2020, almost half of identified suspects were intimate
   partners, a category taken to include romantic partners, sex work
   clients, and other relationships.^51 Even with less than 15 percent of
   law enforcement departments nationwide reporting hate crime data, 227
   crimes motivated at least in part by gender identity bias were recorded
   by the FBI in 2019, including intimidation, vandalism, and simple and
   aggravated assault.^52 Violence also occurs in many settings: A
   Washington, D.C., survey found that perpetrators of physical assault
   against transgender people include co-workers, students and school
   staff, police, incarcerated people and prison staff, and shelter
   residents or staff.^53

   Violence has serious health consequences, both physical and mental.
   Estimates of the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in
   transgender population samples range from 18 percent to 61 percent,
   compared with 6.8 percent among the general adult population.^54

The context of transgender health disparities: Social determinants of
health and minority stress

   Disparities in health status, health care access, and health
   outcomes often arise from conditions that are not explicitly associated
   with the medical system or the nature of transgender identity but are
   driven by broader social determinants of health. These determinants
   include factors such as socioeconomic status, education,
   and physical environments.^55 Oppressive structures such as racism,
   sexism, and transphobia influence where transgender people live, how
   they work, what food they can access, and how they are treated in their
   environments.

   For transgender people, social determinants have concrete effects on
   health. High rates of poverty make medical care unaffordable. High
   rates of housing instability disrupt the continuity of care.
   Discrimination by medical providers leads to mistreatment and avoidance
   of care. Discrimination by employers leads to unemployment and
   consequent uninsurance. Criminalization and incarceration disrupt the
   continuity of care and expose transgender people to violence and
   trauma. Addressing the health disparities faced by transgender people
   requires addressing the many structural forms of exclusion,
   discrimination, and violence they endure.

   Additionally, it is impossible to ignore the health effects of minority
   stress. The persistent experience of living in an
   unsafe, degrading environment where one must change behaviors and hide
   one's identity to avoid stigma and discrimination^56 is itself a public
   health problem that generates unique and pronounced disparities between
   transgender people and others.

   In context, then, transgender health is a multifaceted social,
   economic, and political issue. Furthermore, many transgender people
   are people of color, people with disabilities, sex workers, or
   immigrants; their experiences of stigma, discrimination, and socially
   determined health conditions are distinctive and
   intersectional. Efforts to address transgender health
   disparities therefore run the risk of leaving many behind if they do
   not center the effects of racism, misogyny, criminalization, ableism,
   and xenophobia on transgender people's health.

Social determinants of health and adverse health outcomes

Family rejection

   High rates of rejection from family members are a major contributor to
   poor health outcomes among transgender people. According to TransPop
   data, 44 percent of transgender individuals had a parent physically
   hurt them at least once during childhood,^57 compared with 25 percent
   of cisgender heterosexual respondents. Many transgender people report
   having a more strained or conflicted relationship with their parents
   than their cisgender heterosexual counterparts (57 percent^58 compared
   with 22 percent), and many more report being bullied as a minor (46
   percent^59 compared with 17 percent). According to the U.S. Transgender
   Survey, 8 percent of transgender individuals report being kicked out of
   their home for being transgender, and 10 percent report running away
   from home.^60 This contributes to the fact that 30 percent of
   transgender individuals have experienced homelessness at some point in
   their lifetime--a number that increases to 51 percent among Black
   transgender women.^61 Family rejection is also associated with both the
   misuse of drugs and alcohol and attempted suicide.^62

Barriers to economic security

   Broadly, transgender individuals encounter systemic and institutional
   discrimination and barriers to economic security. According to TransPop
   data, 62 percent of respondents report a personal income of below
   $25,000 annually, compared with 40 percent of cisgender heterosexual
   respondents. More than 1 in 4 transgender respondents from CAP's 2020
   survey reported a household income of less than $25,000 annually.^63
   (see Figure 8) Staggeringly, a survey of transgender and
   gender-nonconforming individuals in the southeastern United States
   found that 79 percent were food insecure.^64 Disparities in economic
   security and access to food have been proven to affect health status;
   one survey of transgender individuals in New York state found that
   those with incomes below the poverty line were almost twice as likely
   to report fair or poor health.^65 These obstacles not only exacerbate
   stress, leading to mental and physical ailments, but also make it more
   difficult for transgender individuals to afford quality care. More than
   half of transgender individuals reported postponing or not receiving
   necessary medical care in the year prior to CAP's survey because they
   could not afford it, including 60 percent of transgender respondents of
   color. And 40 percent avoided preventive screenings in the year prior
   to CAP's survey due to cost, including 31 percent of transgender
   respondents of color.^66

   Figure 8

   IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MKnkC

   The reliance of the U.S. health insurance system on employer-provided
   coverage creates barriers to care for populations that are vulnerable
   to unemployment and employment discrimination.^67 In a 2020 CAP survey,
   27 percent of transgender respondents reported that they were currently
   unemployed.^68 More than half of transgender individuals reported that
   discrimination moderately or significantly affected their capacity to
   be hired in the year prior to CAP's survey, while nearly half reported
   that discrimination had a moderate or significant effect on their
   ability to retain employment in the year prior to the survey--with
   rates of reported discrimination significantly increasing for
   transgender people of color.^69 (see Figure 9) This discrimination
   leads to labor market exclusion and lower rates of insurance through
   employers, with transgender individuals reporting receiving
   employer-based insurance at a rate 7 percentage points lower than
   cisgender LGBTQI+ individuals.^70 Overall, transgender adults report
   uninsurance rates that are 7 percentage points higher than those of
   cisgender individuals.^71

   Figure 9

   IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1Z9Q5

Housing insecurity and experiences of homelessness

   Barriers to economic opportunities, labor and housing market
   discrimination and exclusion, lack of legal protections, and family
   rejection are main contributors to transgender people experiencing
   disproportionately high rates of homelessness. Nearly one-third of
   transgender individuals report living in poverty--compared with just 12
   percent of the U.S. population^72--limiting their capacity to afford
   rent or mortgage payments. A majority of states lack legal protections
   in housing based on gender identity,^73 and 23 percent of transgender
   individuals--including 49 percent of Black transgender
   individuals--have reported experiencing some form of housing
   discrimination, including eviction and the denial of a home or
   apartment.^74 (see Figure 10) For example, CAP survey data show that 52
   percent of transgender individuals reported that discrimination
   negatively affected their ability to rent or buy a home to some degree
   in the year prior to the survey, compared with 36 percent of cisgender
   LGBQI+ respondents. On a basic level, housing is essential to physical
   and mental health. Safe and stable housing means access to clean water,
   significantly reduced likelihood of contracting diseases and physical
   ailments, the proper storage of medications, improved mental health,
   and reduced health care costs.^75

   Figure 10

   IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Myyxr

   High rates of homelessness have detrimental effects on mental and
   physical health and are associated with high rates of drug use,
   depression, anxiety, and suicide.^76 These effects are worsened due to
   the lack of safe shelter access. Among transgender individuals who have
   stayed in shelters, 70 percent have reported experiencing harassment,
   physical assault, or removal.^77 (see Figure 11) One in 4 transgender
   individuals experiencing homelessness report avoiding homeless shelters
   for fear of harassment, and an additional 6 percent have been denied
   access to shelter,^78 contributing to 63 percent of transgender people
   experiencing homelessness also being unsheltered.^79 Among unsheltered
   transgender populations, 60 percent are trimorbid, facing co-occurring
   physical, mental, and substance use disorders.^80 Unsheltered
   transgender people are more than seven times as likely to have police
   interactions and more than eight times as likely to be sent to jail or
   prison than transgender individuals who are sheltered. Those numbers
   increase among Black unsheltered transgender individuals.^81

   Figure 11

   IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/q87nJ

Interactions with the criminal legal system

   Transgender individuals are much more likely than their cisgender
   counterparts both to have negative encounters with law enforcement and
   to face mental and physical health concerns due to incarceration. Data
   from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey show that of respondents who had
   a police encounter in the year prior, 58 percent experienced some form
   of mistreatment, including 61 percent of Black respondents and 71
   percent of Latino/a respondents.^82 Police often target transgender
   people in discretionary interactions. One study of Latina transgender
   women in Los Angeles found that 60 percent of those who had been
   stopped by the police had not violated any laws.^83 Most prominently,
   police often use the pretext that transgender individuals--particularly
   transgender women, and especially transgender women of color--are sex
   workers to create grounds to accost or detain them.^84 This practice is
   made easier by state statutes criminalizing loitering and practices
   allowing the possession of condoms to be used as justification for
   arrest and evidence of prostitution. These policies are so often used
   to target transgender people that they are referred to as "walking
   while trans" laws.^85 Staggeringly, 22 percent of individuals from the
   U.S. Transgender Survey who were arrested believe that they were
   arrested as a result of their gender identity,^86 likely contributing
   to CAP survey data showing that 50 percent of transgender individuals
   report avoiding police to avoid experiencing discrimination, compared
   with 29 percent of cisgender LGBQI+ respondents.

   Higher rates of contact with the criminal legal system mean that
   transgender individuals are incarcerated at a rate two times that of
   cisgender individuals.^87 These rates are even higher among transgender
   people of color; for example, Black transgender women are incarcerated
   at a rate 10 times that of the cisgender population. Incarcerated
   transgender people are often placed in housing in accordance with their
   gender assigned at birth; are nearly 10 times as likely to be assaulted
   than the general prison population; and face constant harassment from
   staff and other incarcerated persons.^88 Many are also disallowed from
   continuing necessary transition care. One in 3 incarcerated transgender
   people who had been taking hormones prior to their incarceration were
   prohibited from taking them.^89

Detention settings

   Immigrants in detention centers face similar difficulties. Transgender
   individuals being held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
   (ICE) in 2017 were detained more than twice as long as the general
   population.^90 One in 8 reported being held in solitary confinement,^91
   and many have reported experiences of physical abuse and denial of
   gender-appropriate clothing.^92 Twelve percent of LGBT individuals
   overall report experiencing sexual abuse and assault, making them 97
   times as likely to be sexually victimized than non-LGBT people in
   custody.^93 There are many reports of transgender individuals being
   denied access to basic health care, including hormone therapy and
   necessary care for those living with HIV.^94

Inaccurate identity documents

   Barriers to obtaining accurate identity documents present additional
   challenges. State-level restrictions on gender marker and legal name
   changes vary,^95 with many states requiring approval by a medical
   provider or court order. These restrictions make identification changes
   dependent on health care access and therefore inaccessible to many,
   especially when specific medical procedures are required. Even more
   barriers to identification changes exist for transgender people with
   criminal records, who already face unique risks associated with
   discrimination and law enforcement interactions.^96 CAP's survey shows
   that 66 percent of transgender respondents reported discrimination
   having an impact on their ability to obtain accurate identification
   documents in the year prior to the survey, compared with 23 percent of
   cisgender LGB respondents. TransPop data show that 1 in 2 transgender
   respondents have no identification with their authentic name, and just
   1 in 3 have any identification with their authentic pronouns. In
   practice, this may expose transgender people to harassment, violence,
   and administrative barriers when engaging with health care providers,
   the legal system, law enforcement, stores, and banks. Among those whose
   identifications do not reflect their current name or gender, 25 percent
   of transgender people have been verbally harassed and 16 percent have
   been denied services or benefits.^97 Incongruence between
   identification documents and gender identity has also been associated
   with worsened mental health, including higher levels of anxiety,
   depression, and adverse responses to gender-based mistreatment.^98

The context of barriers to care for transgender people: Medical system
hostility

   Hospitals, clinics, and doctors' offices should be safe environments
   where people are given the medical care they need. For many transgender
   people, this is not the case. Even when providers do not outright
   refuse to treat transgender people, they may verbally abuse or
   physically harm their transgender patients.^99 Refusal and abuse of
   transgender people of color is even more common.^100

   For transgender people who use drugs, have disabilities, or experience
   mental illness, medical system involvement also carries the risk of
   institutionalization or contact with the criminal legal system. Medical
   systems can be hostile and discriminatory due to racism and sexism
   as well,^101 and this hostility is often inseparable from transphobia.
   Medical system hostility has led to a long-standing reliance by
   transgender communities on black markets and informal networks to
   obtain gender-affirming care--practices that have resurfaced as the
   COVID-19 pandemic erects new barriers. For many, the risks of
   unregulated substance distribution and potential legal consequences
   feel safer than having to engage with health care providers.^102

   Supporting transgender people through the medical system can only be
   achieved with the trust of transgender patients. This trust has been
   violated repeatedly, violently, and fatally--from the long-standing
   classification of transgender identity as a mental
   disorder^103 to the psychologically abusive use of pseudoscientific
   conversion therapy^104 to the historical and continued failure
   of public health responses to the HIV epidemic.^105 Medical systems
   must earn transgender people's trust if they hope to effectively
   address health disparities.

Receiving adequate care

   Transgender individuals face additional barriers due to a lack of
   cultural competency in how to provide treatment for transgender and
   gender-diverse populations. One in 3 transgender people reported having
   to teach their doctor about transgender people in order to receive
   appropriate care in the year prior to CAP's survey.^106 And 15 percent
   report being asked "invasive or unnecessary questions about being
   transgender" not related to their reason for visiting.^107 Sixty-two
   percent of transgender respondents from the TransPop survey reported
   worrying about being judged because of their sexual orientation or
   gender identity when seeking health care,^108 with 63 percent agreeing
   that they worry evaluations of them will be negatively affected by
   these factors. (see Figure 12) More than half of medical school
   curricula lack information about the unique health issues and treatment
   of LGBT people beyond work related to HIV, likely contributing to
   transgender people's inability to access affirming care.^109 Notably,
   just 20 percent of transgender respondents to TransPop report being
   very satisfied with the health care they receive, compared with 45
   percent of cisgender heterosexual respondents. And 20 percent of
   transgender respondents report having no place to go when sick or need
   advice about health,^110 compared with 10 percent of cisgender
   heterosexual respondents.

   Discrimination also affects the ability to access services, as TransPop
   data show that 61 percent of transgender respondents report having a
   personal doctor or health care provider,^111 compared with 76 percent
   of cisgender heterosexual respondents. Transgender individuals are less
   likely to have access to reproductive health services,^112 and 37
   percent have to travel more than 10 miles in order to receive routine
   health care.^113

   Figure 13

   IFRAME: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fknWn

   Further damaging are the high rates at which health care providers
   mistreat and abuse transgender adults. Nearly 1 in 2 transgender
   individuals, including 68 percent of transgender people of color,
   reported experiencing mistreatment at the hands of a provider in the
   year prior to CAP's survey, including care refusal as well as verbal or
   physical abuse.^114 (see Figure 13) Twenty-eight percent of transgender
   individuals reported postponing or not receiving necessary medical
   care in the year prior to CAP's survey for fear of experiencing
   discrimination, including 22 percent of transgender people of color.
   (see Figure 14) Stigma and discrimination from health care providers
   has also been explicitly linked to increased levels of substance use
   among transgender individuals.^115

   Existing barriers to accessing medically necessary gender-affirming
   care create additional obstacles. Forty-six percent of transgender
   individuals had a health insurer deny them gender-affirming care in the
   year prior to CAP's survey.^116 Fifty-five percent of transgender
   individuals report needing to travel at least 10 miles in order to
   receive transition-related care,^117 which can make it inaccessible for
   many. Notably, while 78 percent of respondents to the U.S. Transgender

   only 49 percent of respondents have ever received it, and just 25
   percent of respondents have had some form of transition-related

Current landscape of legal and regulatory nondiscrimination protections in
health care

   The landscape of legal protections in health care that prohibit
   discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)
   has evolved drastically in recent years. The sections below highlight
   notable legal and regulatory developments and recommendations for
   further action under the Biden administration. These recommendations
   are essential to building a more transgender-inclusive legal apparatus
   but should also be paired with in-practice policies set out below that
   promote affirming, quality care.

The Bostock decision and President Joe Biden's executive order

   On June 15, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed in Bostock v. Clayton
   County^119 that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964's prohibition
   on sex discrimination in employment encompasses discrimination based on
   SOGI. Prior to the high court's landmark decision, courts across the
   country were already interpreting sex discrimination to also prohibit
   SOGI discrimination, not just in Title VII but also in other statutes
   that prohibit sex discrimination,^120 such as Title IX, Section 1557 of
   the ACA, and the Fair Housing Act.^121 On day one of his presidency,
   President Biden signed a groundbreaking executive order^122 (EO)
   directing all agencies to enforce federal laws prohibiting sex
   discrimination to also prohibit discrimination based on SOGI in areas
   including but not limited to employment, housing, health care,
   education, and credit. The EO implements the Bostock decision
   throughout the country's major civil rights laws to consistently
   protect LGBTQ people from discrimination^123 and ensure equal
   protection under the law.

Recommendations

     * Federal agencies should fully implement EO 13988 across the
       government. Implementation of the EO on Preventing and Combating
       Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual
       Orientation^124 throughout the government, including in the realms
       of health care, health insurance, and provision of services is
       essential. Doing so not only accurately reflects the current state
       of the law but is also supported by the large^125 majority^126 of
       Americans who oppose discrimination against transgender people. EO
       13988 granted each agency head 100 days to develop plans in
       consultation with the U.S. attorney general to carry out actions to
       revise, suspend, rescind previous agency actions or to promulgate
       new agency actions as necessary to fully implement statutes that
       prohibit sex discrimination to also prohibit discrimination based
       on SOGI. As explained below, the U.S. Department of Health and
       Human Services (HHS) has started announcing actions to better
       enforce SOGI nondiscrimination protections. However, it has not yet
       released its plan and should do so as soon as possible. Fully
       implementing these nondiscrimination protections throughout the
       country's health care system is vital, especially given the current
       wave of discriminatory, dangerous, and harmful state bills that aim
       to strip transgender people of their rights and ability to access
       to health care. As highlighted in the previous section,
       discrimination affects transgender communities across multiple,
       intersecting areas of life, including health care, employment, and
       housing. It is therefore imperative that all federal agencies
       release their plans detailing how they will use their authority to
       implement SOGI nondiscrimination practices. Congress' passage of
       the Equality Act will also be imperative to combating
       discrimination in multiple key areas of life that jeopardize the
       ability of transgender people to access health care and maintain
       economic security. And it would provide legal recourse from
       discrimination in public spaces and services as well as federally
       funded programs.^127
     * Reverse the Trump administration's overly broad religious
       exemptions. In implementing this historic EO, the Biden
       administration should also act across agencies to reverse the Trump
       administration's expansion of overly broad religious exemptions in
       health care with the aim of instituting a transparent and effective
       process for determining religious exemptions and third-party
       burdens. Doing so is particularly important given the increased
       rate of consolidation among hospitals to those affiliated with
       Catholic systems and the fact that more than 1 in 6 hospital beds
       are in Catholic hospitals, many of which follow
       transgender-exclusive ethical and religious directives from the
       U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.^128

     schedule the surgery in person. The hospital staff misgendered Tyler
     and denied her gender-affirming surgery, citing their religious
     directives. She felt humiliated and dehumanized.""

Discrimination in health care settings

   Section 1557 is the primary nondiscrimination provision of the ACA,
   which prohibits health programs or facilities that receive federal
   funding from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, age,
   disability, or sex. Notably, Section 1557 incorporates the grounds and
   enforcement of mechanisms of various civil rights statutes, including
   Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972's prohibition on sex
   discrimination in health care programs and activities, a statute which
   many courts have consistently found applies to discrimination on the
   basis of SOGI.^129 Overall, the Section 1557 statute incorporates the
   grounds of existing federal civil rights laws and prohibits
   discrimination by federally funded health programs such that an
   individual cannot be excluded from participation in, be denied the
   benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination on these bases by any
   health program or activity that receives federal financial
   assistance.^130

   In 2016, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a historic^131
   rule codifying nondiscrimination protections for transgender people in
   health facilities, programs, and activities that receive federal
   funding. The rule clarified^132 that the sex nondiscrimination
   protections in Section 1557 explicitly protect transgender individuals
   on the basis of gender identity and confirmed that individuals must
   have access to health care facilities and programs that are in
   accordance with their gender identity. Regrettably, in 2020, the Trump
   administration promulgated a final rule creating numerous harms by
   attempting to erase specific nondiscrimination protections based on
   gender identity and sex stereotyping.^133 Litigation over the final
   rule is ongoing,^134 but courts have affirmed that gender identity
   discrimination is prohibited under the statute itself as well as under
   the 2016 rule's protections based on "sex stereotyping," and some parts
   of the 2020 final rule related to LGBT people are currently
   enjoined.^135 In light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Bostock and
   subsequent court decisions, on May 10, 2021, the HHS announced that the
   OCR will interpret and enforce Section 1557 of the ACA and Title IX's
   prohibition on discrimination based on sex to include discrimination on
   the basis of SOGI.^136 The OCR simultaneously issued a notice of this
   new interpretation and its intent to accept, investigate, and resolve
   complaints of health care discrimination on the basis of SOGI under
   Section 1557.^137

Recommendation

     * Engage in rule-making to strengthen nondiscrimination protections
       in Section 1557 and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
       (CMS) regulations. While the interpretation helps to clarify
       explicit protections for LGBTQ people in federally funded health
       programs under Section 1557, numerous questions remain. For
       example, the announcement does not provide additional guidance or
       examples on what it means for covered entities not to discriminate
       based on SOGI and behaviors that could trigger review by the OCR;
       it does not resolve any of the pending litigation over the 2020
       rule; it does not restore protection eliminated by the conforming
       amendments to CMS regulations that were implemented with the 2020
       rule; and it remains unclear how the OCR will approach questions
       surrounding the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,^138 which
       protects the free exercise of religious belief, and how it
       interacts with Section 1557, if at all, as well as prior court
       orders in its enforcement of Section 1557, as stated in the
       announcement.^139 Future rule-making and litigation should be
       expected. The administration should engage in notice-and-comment
       rule-making at the HHS to strengthen Section 1557's
       nondiscrimination protections by explicitly prohibiting
       discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
       expression, gender transition, transgender status, sex stereotypes,
       and sex characteristics (including intersex traits) and clarify the
       same scope of claims and remedies exist under Section 1557
       regardless of the type of discrimination; reverse the CMS
       conforming amendments and clarify the scope of coverage and
       nondiscrimination in CMS rules for the Marketplace, Medicaid, and
       Medicare; and clarify protections for transgender and
       gender-diverse patients in health care and coverage by adopting
       regulatory and preamble language, guidance, technical assistance
       and enforcement efforts that underscore the wide range of scenarios
       in which discrimination against transgender patients can occur and
       is prohibited under federal law. Finally, the HHS should publish
       the 2016 proposed rule^140 establishing explicit nondiscrimination
       protections on the basis of SOGI within the Medicare and Medicaid
       conditions of participation for health care organizations. These
       conditions apply to facilities and providers and should include
       strong language about inpatient treatment prohibiting
       discrimination and harassment based on gender identity. The HHS's
       OCR should also publish a yearly report with information about
       complaints and resolutions and disaggregate data by bases of
       complaints and numbers of investigations and complaints closed.

Discrimination in health insurance coverage

     are at a standstill right now because our insurance company does not

     transgender community. This is a life and death matter. Without
     hormone blockers, my son's anxiety and anger will be out of control
     and his mental health will deteriorate.""

   There is a growing consensus among expert and medical organizations
   that gender-affirming health care, including surgical procedures, is
   medically necessary.^141 Historically, however, transgender-specific
   exclusions have been deployed by public and private health insurers to
   deny transgender people coverage for medically necessary care,
   including for care unrelated to gender affirmation.^142 For example,
   insurers would regularly deny transgender people services and
   procedures such as hormone therapy, mental health counseling,
   preventive screenings, and surgeries that are regularly covered for
   cisgender people. The 2016 Section 1557 rule--and many states' changes
   before that^143--prohibited insurers from categorically excluding
   services related to gender-affirming health care, including
   gender-affirming surgeries, and from imposing discriminatory
   restrictions based on gender identity. Notably, numerous court
   decisions have found that these categorical exclusions violate Section
   1557 or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act in employer-provided
   insurance plans.^144 Prior to the 2020 final rule, the number of
   private companies that were eliminating exclusions in their employee
   coverage appeared to be rapidly increasing,^145 and many insurers in
   the individual market removed transgender-specific exclusions, even
   after this part of the rule was enjoined in court.^146 However, the
   Trump administration's final rule eliminated these explicit regulatory
   protections, resulting in a lack of clarity and life-threatening^147
   consequences for transgender people across the country.

Recommendations

     * Clarify that transgender exclusions do not comply with federal law.
       The HHS should issue guidance to state Medicaid directors stating
       that transgender-specific exclusions are out of compliance with
       federal law. This guidance should suggest enforcement mechanisms,
       enumerate the ways in which medical necessity determinations can be
       applied in a discriminatory manner, and urge insurers to
       affirmatively state their plans cover medically necessary care for
       gender dysphoria.^148 State Medicaid programs should immediately
       remove any exclusions and promulgate coverage protocols for
       gender-affirming care that are grounded in the most up-to-date
       medical standards of care in the field of transgender medicine.^149
     * Encourage state and federal regulatory bodies to adopt similar
       affirmative coverage language. These measures should include
       efforts to improve the Center for Consumer Information and
       Insurance Oversight's (CCIIO) review process of plans to ensure
       compliance with state- and federal-level gender identity
       nondiscrimination requirements.^150 Because transgender consumers
       continue to find it challenging to obtain information from insurers
       regarding whether gender-affirming care will be covered,^151 the
       federal government should also invest additional funding in
       LGBTQI-specific outreach and enrollment support for transgender
       consumers in the individual health insurance market and Medicaid.
     * Improve Medicare coverage. Absent a national coverage
       determination,^152 coverage decisions fall on the Medicare
       Administrative Contractors and Medicare Advantage plans,^153 where
       restrictive and discriminatory policies persist. To help address
       this issue, the CMS should add a provision to the Medicare Benefit
       Policy Manual that explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis
       of SOGI when making coverage determinations.
     * Eliminate exclusions and expand care for federal employees.
       Operated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Federal
       Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers health insurance
       coverage for which most federal employees are eligible.^154
       Unfortunately, program members continue to be denied
       gender-affirming care and services regarded as medically necessary
       by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health's
       Standards of Care.^155 Partly or wholly excluding transgender
       health care from employer insurance plans constitutes
       discrimination under federal law.^156 In compliance with the
       recently announced EO on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and
       Accessibility in the Federal Workforce and Section 1557, the OPM
       should take action to remove existing exclusions or other
       restrictions and direct carriers to cover comprehensive
       gender-affirming care through the FEHB to transgender employees,
       including beneficiaries and eligible dependents.^157 Furthermore,
       in light of its recent announcement,^158 the U.S. Department of
       Veterans Affairs (VA) should act to remove the existing
       discriminatory exclusion for gender-affirming surgical care,^159 as
       well as any other restrictions that limit the ability of
       transgender veterans to access gender-affirming care.^160
     * Explicitly clarify protections for transgender patients in health
       care. Any notice-and-comment rule-making related to Section 1557
       should clarify protections for transgender and gender-diverse
       patients in health care and coverage. Through the rule, enforcement
       mechanisms, and technical assistance to insurers and providers, the
       HHS should provide clear guidance on what it means for covered
       entities and providers not to discriminate against transgender
       patients and the wide range of scenarios in which discrimination
       can occur. At a minimum, the CMS should issue a letter to state
       Medicaid directors notifying them of these actions and clarifying
       protections.
     * Improve enforcement and accountability through technical assistance
       and oversight. While studies show that insurers have largely moved
       away from transgender-specific categorical exclusions in plans,
       insurers continue to discriminatorily reject coverage.^161 As such,
       to promote enforcement and accountability among insurers, the above
       actions should be paired with technical assistance and oversight
       mechanisms through the CCIIO. To ensure HHS enforcement of these
       nondiscrimination protections will require a strong Section 1557
       rule and an OCR that is adequately funded to meet its caseload and
       investigate complaints thoroughly. Filing lawsuits against entities
       violating nondiscrimination protections in health care places labor
       and a fiscal burden on patients, while proactive civil rights
       enforcement mechanisms will institute systemic accountability and
       lessen that burden. The OCR should simultaneously implement
       awareness campaigns to ensure that transgender people are aware of
       their right to nondiscrimination and lift up highly valuable
       community-based legal resources. (see Appendix B)

HHS grants regulation

   Grants issued by the HHS total more than $500 billion annually^162 and
   fund a wide array of programs and services that transgender people rely
   on--including those addressing substance use and mental health,
   homelessness, intimate partner violence, anti-bullying efforts, aging
   care, and people living with HIV/AIDS.^163 These programs and services
   are critical to addressing the various physical, mental, and behavioral
   health disparities highlighted throughout this report. The HHS's
   central nondiscrimination regulation for federal awards required
   HHS-funded service providers not to discriminate based on nonmerit
   factors such as sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, among
   others.^164 In November 2019, however, the Trump administration
   released a notice of nonenforcement for key nondiscrimination
   provisions for many HHS programs,^165 and in January 2021 it finalized
   a rule^166 that strips beneficiaries of HHS-funded services of these
   explicit comprehensive nondiscrimination protections and attempts to
   permit service providers to discriminate based on nonmerit factors
   including sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.^167 There are
   lawsuits currently pending against both the notice of nonenforcement
   and the grants rule.^168

Recommendation

     * Immediately rescind the 2019 notice of nonenforcement and restore
       nondiscrimination protections. In addition to rescinding the notice
       of nonenforcement issued in 2019, the Biden administration should
       work to restore protections by engaging in notice-and-comment
       rule-making to rescind the final grants rule, which has yet to go
       into effect but is set to go into effect in August 2021.^169 The
       HHS should also clearly require nondiscrimination as a condition of
       issuing grants and avoid overly broad religious exemptions that
       remove crucial safeguards designed to protect people accessing
       government-funded services at faith-based providers from
       discrimination.

COVID-19 administrative actions

   Transgender communities have been hit especially hard by the health,
   economic, and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.^170 In addition
   to being at greater risk of suffering severe illness from the
   coronavirus,^171 transgender people reported experiencing
   disproportionately high rates of serious financial hardship and
   employment disruption during the pandemic, undermining their economic
   security, housing stability, and ability to afford and access care.
   ^172

Recommendations

     * Integrate targeted relief for transgender communities into
       coronavirus testing, vaccine, and recovery efforts. During the
       first days of his presidency, President Biden signed various EOs to
       promote a strategic, data-driven, and equity-centered approach to
       addressing the pandemic.^173 These actions should be used as an
       opportunity to integrate targeted relief to support transgender
       communities. For example, federal and state governments should
       partner with and financially support community-based organizations
       to issue vaccine distribution plans and outreach campaigns
       targeting transgender communities; share information about
       accessing testing, vaccines, and the right to receive services free
       from discrimination under the law; and dispel misinformation about
       how vaccines may interfere with transition-related care.^174 The
       pandemic has also highlighted the need for a national paid sick
       leave policy. The administration should continue to support efforts
       to expand paid medical and family leave for transgender people by
       adopting an inclusive definition of chosen-family caregiving
       relationships^175--a provision included in the president's proposed
       American Families Plan, which Congress should act to adopt.^176
     * Enhance data collection to shed light on the experiences of
       transgender people during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are numerous
       steps that the HHS, with the support of the COVID-19 Health Equity
       Task Force, should take to support data collection that will
       provide greater clarity on the experiences of transgender people
       during the pandemic.^177 The existing COVID-19 laboratory data
       guidance from the HHS^178 should be revised to require voluntary
       data collection and reporting on SOGI in COVID-19 testing, care,
       and vaccination uptake in a manner that protects privacy and
       confidentiality for individuals. Moreover, the Centers for Disease
       Control and Prevention (CDC) case report form^179 should add SOGI
       questions and alter its sex question response options to be more
       inclusive. Additionally, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative
       and Office should add SOGI to its COVID-19 Clinical Data Warehouse
       Data Dictionary, and the national coordinator of health information
       technology should require the HL7 electronic health record to add
       SOGI measures to foster better data exchanges between clinical and
       reporting systems. Finally, the HHS should ensure the CDC's Data
       Modernization Initiative^180 directs funding to and prioritizes
       expanding and enhancing SOGI data collection in public health
       surveillance. Taking these steps is essential to collect more
       accurate information on transgender peoples' health needs, bring
       visibility to their experiences throughout the pandemic, and help
       federal, state, and local programs reduce disparities and improve
       access to care during the pandemic and beyond.

Data collection

   Persistent lack of routine data collection on gender identity, as well
   as sexual orientation and intersex status, remains a significant
   barrier for researchers, advocates, and policymakers alike.^181 Data
   collection mechanisms often conflate sex and gender or rely solely on a
   binary model of sex and gender that fails to capture health outcomes
   for transgender and other gender-diverse populations.^182 To better
   understand and address health disparities that transgender communities
   face, it is imperative that federal agencies, including the HHS, the
   U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Labor, expand
   and enhance data collection efforts to add measures for SOGI and to
   test and implement intersex status measures. Doing so is crucial to
   advancing research agendas, evaluating population trends, equitably
   distributing funding resources, tracking and addressing discrimination,
   and designing evidence-based policy solutions to promote equity and
   reduce existing disparities that transgender communities face across
   key areas of life.^183

Recommendations

     * Expand and enhance data collection efforts under the HHS. For
       example, the CDC should prioritize adding SOGI measures to the
       standardized demographic core questionnaire of the BRFSS and the
       National Violent Death Reporting System as well as adding gender
       identity questions to the National Health Interview Survey.
       Expansion of data collection should be paired with funding,
       technical assistance, and training to facilitate implementation and
       ensure high standards for collection, storage, sharing, and use
       that promote security and confidentiality. These actions should
       include efforts to meaningfully engage directly with transgender
       communities and organizations for the purposes of qualitative and
       quantitative research.

Access to identification documents

   Gender-incongruent forms of identification expose transgender people to
   a range of adverse outcomes and pose a significant barrier to accessing
   a wide range of services, including those related to health care.
   Unfortunately, many states^184 still impose intrusive and burdensome
   requirements^185 for transgender people to update their IDs--such as
   providing proof of surgery or court orders--to amend driver's licenses
   or birth certificates. In June 2021, President Biden signed an EO on
   Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal
   Workforce,^186 directing relevant agencies to take steps to facilitate
   access to identity credentials that meet the needs of transgender,
   gender-nonconforming, and nonbinary employees and to reduce unnecessary
   administrative burden for updating employee identity credentials. Also
   in June 2021, the U.S. Department of State announced it will be
   updating procedures for issuance of U.S. passports and consular reports
   of birth abroad to allow applicants to "self-select their gender as `M'
   or `F' and will no longer require medical certification if an
   applicant's self-selected gender does not match the gender on their
   other citizenship or identity documents."^187

Recommendation

     * Facilitate the process through which transgender people acquire
       accurate IDs. As part of the EO on Advancing Racial Equity and
       Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal
       Government,^188 all relevant federal agencies ensure that wherever
       federal ID documents or administrative records list gender,
       individuals can select a designation for M, F, or X, and remove
       medical certification. Gender-incongruent identification increases
       the risk of exposing transgender people to discrimination,
       harassment, violence, and administrative barriers when engaging in
       a variety of settings. As such, states should also modernize their
       policies or processes for transgender people to access
       identification--such as driver's licenses, birth certificates, and
       legal name changes--that matches their gender identity.^189

In-practice policies to promote affirming, inclusive, and culturally
competent care

Beyond nondiscrimination legal protections

   Nondiscrimination protections alone cannot rectify the health
   consequences of the long-standing structural exclusion that transgender
   people face. Access to legal recourse in instances of discrimination in
   health care does not address many of the social determinants
   contributing to inadequate health care, such as persistent poverty,
   criminalization, and unemployment. Furthermore, many harmful actions by
   providers may not constitute or be recognized as formal
   discrimination--even with protections, mistreatment and consequent
   avoidance will continue. Proactive efforts to promote access to health
   care, including through targeted support for affirming health care
   programs and increasing cultural competence among health care
   providers, are also needed.

   Needs beyond nondiscrimination protections are visible in locations
   such as Washington, D.C. Despite the district having some of the most
   transgender-inclusive health care protections in the country,^190 a DC
   Trans Coalition survey found that transgender people in Washington,
   D.C., were much more likely to be uninsured, HIV positive, use illicit
   substances, or experience suicidality, with transgender people of color
   reporting higher rates in all these categories.^191 The organization's
   community needs assessment found that access to "trans-sensitive health
   care" was the community's top priority.^192 A further study of sex
   workers in Washington, D.C., most of whom were transgender, identified
   sex work criminalization and housing insecurity as the primary barriers
   to their health and well-being.^193

   Trans-sensitive health care is not simply access to medical transition
   through hormones and surgeries. While medical transition is widely
   recognized as holistically beneficial to those who seek it out,^194 the
   pressing health care needs of many transgender people include care for
   chronic conditions,^195 care associated with disability, and mental
   health treatment^196--and not all transgender people would choose to
   medically transition even if this care were available.

   Meanwhile, many health providers lack basic knowledge of the health
   experiences of transgender people and must increase their cultural
   competence to effectively serve their transgender patients. According
   to CAP's nationally representative survey, in the year prior, 33
   percent of transgender respondents reported having to teach their
   doctor or provider about transgender people in order to receive
   appropriate care; 32 percent of respondents reported misgendering by
   doctors or providers; and 38 percent reported providers being visibly
   uncomfortable due to actual or perceived gender identity. Transgender
   people of color faced even higher rates of mistreatment in all these
   categories.^197
     * Twitter

     ""]"I broke my foot and I went to physical therapy and they wouldn't
     respect my pronouns at all [...] They would change me a lot [to
     new/different physical therapists]. They would switch me around
     because they were tired of me telling them to use the right
     pronouns. They would change me to different people because they
     didn't want to deal with respecting my pronouns. So, I stopped and
     now my foot is hurt really badly. Walking hurts.""

   Resources for training insurers, providers, and administrative staff in
   cultural competence are already available.^198 Adding funding and
   guidance from federal and state governments would aid in ensuring their
   widespread implementation, as would increased emphasis on cultural
   competence in the standard education of health care providers.

   Evidence demonstrates the multifaceted harms of unsupportive,
   stigmatizing, and discriminatory care and highlights the benefits of
   culturally competent, inclusive, and gender-affirming care.^199 The
   below sections offer recommendations for in-practice policies and
   procedures that should be adopted by health providers.^200 Notably,
   these policies are interconnected and should be implemented together to
   foster a holistically inclusive and supporting health care environment
   for transgender and gender-nonconforming patients.

Increase funding for programs that advance the health of transgender
communities

   The data and findings presented throughout this report highlight the
   significant and intersectional impacts that discrimination, minority
   stress, violence, and various social determinants of health have on the
   physical, mental, and behavioral health of transgender adults. In
   addition to the nondiscrimination regulatory and in-practice policies
   recommended here, there are multiple broad-based policies and
   investments beyond the scope of this report that will also help to
   address the myriad harms, barriers to care, and disparities that
   transgender communities face. For example,^201 the Biden
   administration, Congress, and state and local governments should
   increase funding and support for entities providing LGBTQI+ family
   acceptance models; integrated and culturally competent mental and
   behavioral health services that take a trauma-informed, harm-reduction
   approach; LGBTQI+ community health centers; affordable housing models
   that are explicitly designed for transgender communities; efforts to
   combat violence and improve attitudes toward transgender people;^202
   collaborative, restorative justice, and community-centered
   organizations providing LGBTQI+ survivors of violence with support
   services; and LGBTQI+ and HIV-targeted reentry services.^203
   Furthermore, the administration should continue to incentivize Medicaid
   expansion in states that have failed to do so; encourage states to
   expand reimbursement and utilization of telemedicine services through
   Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program; and work with
   Congress to permanently expand the American Rescue Plan Act's provision
   of lower health insurance premiums for people purchasing coverage on
   the ACA exchanges, as recently proposed in the American Families Plan.
   Improving access to these kinds of crucial programs and services is a
   cross-cutting endeavor that requires strategic coordination among
   different federal and state actors.

Adopt LGBTQI-inclusive administrative data systems

   Many health care-related forms fail to include informational options
   that reflect the diversity of sexual and gender identities, and family
   types. Health care providers should review their current documentation
   policies and protocols, as well as intake forms, to ensure
   inclusive^204 language^205 and form options related to SOGI and
   intersex demographic questions, authentic names and pronouns,
   relationship status and definitions of family, as well as questions
   related to sexual history, family planning, and gynecological history.
   Adopting these kinds of inclusive forms must also be paired with
   administrative procedures and training to ensure patients are not
   misgendered or subject to other kinds of violence and abuse. Health
   care institutions should also adopt existing best practices for
   collecting gender identity data in electronic health records.^206

Foster affirming environments in health care settings

   Given the widespread discrimination and negative experiences that
   transgender people encounter in health settings, as well as the
   historic pathologizing of transgender people by the medical community,
   it is crucial for health care providers to communicate to transgender
   patients that they are entering an inclusive and affirming environment
   where they will be treated with respect. In addition to staff training,
   it is important that the physical space and materials available to
   patients are inclusive of LGBTQI+ people. At minimum, for example, the
   terms "sexual orientation," "gender identity," "gender expression," and
   "sex characteristics" should be added to providers' nondiscrimination
   policy--and placed in areas of high visibility--as well as added to
   patient handouts and providers' websites.^207 Additionally, materials
   specific to the needs of transgender patients related to general care
   and gender-affirming care should be available and visible. Where
   possible, patient navigation services for transgender patients seeking
   gender-affirming care should be provided.

Provide regular staff training on cultural competency and readiness

   It is imperative that both administrative staff and clinical providers
   receive annual cultural competency training related to transgender and
   gender-diverse identities and terminology, as well as how to avoid
   stereotyping or making assumptions about a patient's gender
   identity.^208 Mandatory training^209 for front-line staff should also
   include materials on best practices related to addressing patients,
   using names and pronouns, obtaining information related to insurance or
   medical records, and generally creating an affirming environment for
   transgender and nonbinary patients.^210 To ensure implementation, the
   government should include high-quality LGBTQI+ cultural competency as a
   mandatory component in all federally conducted or supported training
   programs for grantees, including federally employed health care
   providers such as those at the VA. The CMS could also encourage
   cultural competency by reinstating the former policy of requiring that
   managed care plans include information in the provider directory on
   whether the Medicare and Medicaid participating providers have
   completed cultural competency training, which should include LGBTQI+
   cultural competency training.^211 The Health Resources and Services
   Administration should receive additional funding to support the
   dissemination and implementation of trainings for health center staff,
   and LGBTQI+ cultural competency training could be incorporated as a
   prerequisite for certification as a community health center.^212

Adopt clinical standards and education on the health experiences and needs of
transgender communities

   Presently, among many clinical providers there exists a lack of
   knowledge and cultural competence concerning the experiences and health
   care needs of transgender people; a lack of mental and behavioral
   health specialist services; and a lack of awareness regarding health
   professionals' own biases resulting in unequal and discriminatory
   treatment that deter people from seeking care and ultimately exacerbate
   disparities.^213 In addition to cultural competency training, clinical
   providers should receive robust medical training and learn education
   curricula about the health care risks and needs of transgender
   populations located within a deeper understanding of the social,
   political, and economic forces that shape existing disparities and
   challenges. It is imperative that providers adopt the most recent
   standards of clinical care from expert bodies, such as the World
   Professional Association for Transgender Health, and that medical
   education institutions explicitly adopt these materials into their
   curricula through bodies such as the Association of American Medical
   Colleges. For example, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
   Administration should develop and disseminate cultural competency
   curricula on LGBTQI+ patients in federally funded medical facilities,
   medical training programs, and providers participating in Medicaid.
   Moreover, the government should incentivize training and education
   related to these clinical standards of care in federally conducted or
   supported training programs for grantees, including federally employed
   health care providers such as those at the VA. States could also work
   to adopt National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically
   Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care, which should be
   continuously modified to be inclusive of and better aligned with
   meeting the needs of transgender and gender-diverse patients.^214

Increase funding for community health centers and other safety net providers

   The historical and continued hostility of insurers and providers has
   led many transgender people to rely on community health centers, which
   were often created by LGBTQI+ communities themselves. While these
   services remain uncommon outside of urban areas and coastal states,
   they provide urgently needed and affordable care targeted to LGBTQI+
   populations.^215 In these areas, support for existing, trusted services
   is essential to transgender health. Federal funding for community
   health centers can be increased through the Health Resources and
   Services Administration designating LGBTQ people as a Medically
   Underserved Population and a Health Professional Shortage Area
   population.^216 Existing health disparities and a shortage of
   culturally competent providers clearly justify these designations,
   which would increase community health centers' access to funding
   streams.^217 The HHS has proposed regulations to restore access to
   Title X funding to many providers and ensure equity for underserved
   populations in the provision of Title X funds.^218 Programs qualify for
   Title X funds due to their provision of family planning
   services, and Title X programs have historically been crucial for
   transgender people due to their low-barrier provision of STI treatment
   and prevention services, basic health maintenance, and gender-affirming
   care.^219 In 2018, for example, 100 Planned Parenthood
   affiliates provided hormone therapy for transgender people,^220 and
   many Title X providers offer comprehensive and targeted care for
   LGBTQ populations.^221 The Trump-era domestic gag rule^222 imposed
   onerous requirements on Title X grantees offering abortion-related care
   or referrals, decimating funding for this essential network
   of providers.^223 In addition to rescinding the domestic gag rule, the
   HHS's efforts to repair Title X should create a pathway for reentry to
   evidence-based Title X grantees excluded due to the gag rule, including
   reissuing the funding opportunity announcement and ensuring protections
   from adverse action by state governments against Title X programs.

Develop policies to prevent violence against transgender people

   The Biden administration has created an Interagency Working Group on
   Safety, Inclusion, and Opportunity for Transgender Americans, which
   is intended in part to address violence against transgender people and
   the factors contributing to it.^224 The establishment of this group
   presents a unique opportunity to coordinate federal policymaking to
   proactively address poverty, housing insecurity, criminalization, and
   resulting outcomes in victimization. Such policies must be developed
   with reliance on the input and expertise of affected people and
   advocates.

   In 2019, only 13.9 percent of law enforcement agencies submitted data
   on hate crimes to the FBI.^225 This drastic underreporting prevents
   research into the scale and nature of gender identity-based violence
   and hampers the development of evidence-based policies to combat it.

   The administration should develop accountability measures for
   noncompliance with hate crime reporting standards, including audits and
   conditioning of federal grants to law enforcement agencies. It should
   also work to establish processes for hate violence reporting outside of
   law enforcement channels, such as through hotlines and local 211 lines
   that may be more trusted by communities vulnerable to negative law
   enforcement interactions.

   Intimate partner violence presents a complex problem for transgender
   people--and one which law enforcement agencies are not equipped to
   address. Economic insecurity can exacerbate intimate partner violence,
   creating special vulnerabilities to financial abuse.^226  Comprehensive
   efforts to improve the economic security of transgender people would
   begin to address these factors. Expanded funding for affirming services
   for survivors of violence and implementation of nondiscrimination
   protections in emergency services such as shelters would mitigate the
   immediate effects of these issues by increasing transgender survivors'
   access to support systems.

   Addressing violence against transgender sex workers is complicated by
   the effects of sex work criminalization on survivors' access to support
   systems and health care.^227 Improved economic security and funding for
   affirming services must be complemented by efforts to advance the
   decriminalization of sex work.

   Policies to prevent violence against transgender people must also
   address the direct role of law enforcement and carceral systems in
   perpetrating this violence. Transgender people are seven times more
   likely than cisgender people to experience physical violence when
   interacting with the police^228 and five times more likely than the
   general population to be sexually assaulted by facility staff in jails,
   prisons, and juvenile detention.^229 These dangers must be addressed
   through broader efforts to decrease law enforcement interactions and
   criminal legal system involvement among transgender people, including
   policies advancing the decriminalization of sex work, rather than
   increased funding for law enforcement training.

Efforts to address the HIV epidemic and support people living with HIV

   CDC data reveal that transgender communities, particularly
   Black/African American transgender people, Hispanic/Latino transgender
   people, and transgender women in general, are disproportionately
   affected by HIV. In 2018, 2 percent of all new HIV diagnoses in the
   United States and dependent areas were among transgender people, with
   disproportionate new HIV diagnoses among Black/African American
   transgender women and Black/African American transgender men, as well
   as among transgender people aged 25 to 34.^230 HIV prevalence is
   roughly 20 times higher among transgender people, and roughly 30 times
   higher among transgender women, than among the general population.^231
   To address existing disparities and continue working toward the HHS's
   goal of ending HIV by 2030^232 requires that biomedical prevention and
   treatment options for HIV only be adopted as part of a more holistic
   approach that recognizes the structural and systemic barriers that lead
   to disproportionate effects among transgender communities of color.
   These barriers include the criminalization of sex work, drug use, and
   HIV status, which prevent many transgender people from safely engaging
   with public health initiatives.^233 The administration must adopt an
   approach that meaningfully involves and centers the experiences of
   people living with HIV and the policy recommendations generated by and
   for communities marginalized by HIV.^234 As part of the CDC's efforts
   to realize the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plan,^235 the authors
   recommend the following actions.

Increase funding for a range of HIV-related programs and initiatives

   For example, budgetary funding increases for all domestic HIV and viral
   hepatitis programs--including Housing Opportunities for People With
   AIDS, the CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis, and the Ryan White
   HIV/AIDS Program--to provide services and supports for low-income
   people with HIV are critical to getting the nation on track to end HIV
   by 2030. The HHS should also work with HIV leaders to modernize the
   Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and continue to increase access to
   essential services for program recipients, thereby reducing barriers to
   access. More broadly, the HHS should fund and scale programs providing
   biomedical prevention and treatment options for HIV such as HIV
   testing, preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis (PrEP and PEP),
   treatment-as-prevention strategies, and long-acting HIV treatment
   options. These actions must be complemented by investments to fund and
   bring to scale innovative messaging and stigma reduction strategies for
   priority HIV populations advanced by the communities of people living
   with HIV, such as Undetectable Equals Untransmittable.

Continue to support strategies for prevention, treatment, and harm reduction

   Strategies to prevent new HIV transmissions should include adequately
   funded collaboration with municipalities and nongovernmental
   organizations able to engage sex workers and people who use drugs^236
   as well as the adoption of evidence-based harm reduction strategies,
   including syringe service programs, medication-assisted treatment, and
   the institution of overdose prevention sites. Syringe exchanges reduce
   the risk of transmission among at-risk populations^237 and must be
   supported, including through a congressional allocation of
   appropriations funds through opioid epidemic initiatives and the
   removal of restrictions on syringe purchases by these programs. This
   would reduce the harms associated with hormone injection, substance
   use, HIV, and hepatitis C among transgender people who cannot easily
   access safe supplies.^238

Revise U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) positions criminalizing overdose
prevention sites

   The DOJ has prevented the development of overdose prevention sites
   through an interpretation of 21 USC § 856, the so-called "crack house
   statute" of the Controlled Substance Act.^239 Decades of research have
   consistently shown the health and safety benefits of overdose
   prevention sites, which provide supervision and safer environments and
   supplies for injection drug use.^240 The DOJ must drop pending cases
   challenging overdose prevention sites and institute policies
   deprioritizing future prosecution of sites under the Controlled
   Substances Act.

Adopt HIV surveillance and research safeguards

   A key pillar of the EHE, the molecular HIV surveillance (MHS) collects
   and tracks people's biological data with the aim of allowing public
   health systems to trace networks of HIV transmission and identify
   transmission clusters to offer prevention and health care services.^241
   Unfortunately, these surveillance systems utilize and share data
   without the consent of people living with HIV and lack meaningful
   accountability mechanisms, exacerbating mistrust among people living
   with HIV and concerns about whether data will be used to criminalize
   these communities.^242 More than 30 states have laws criminalizing HIV
   transmission, exposure, or nondisclosure that state legislatures should
   repeal.^243 The CDC should issue a moratorium on MHS until adequate
   safeguards are created and implemented to protect the privacy and
   autonomy of people living with HIV, bolster community trust, and
   eliminate opportunities for criminalization and other unintended
   consequences. Implementation of surveillance systems must be responsive
   to the input of networks of people living with HIV.

Conclusion

   Discrimination, stigma, poverty, and violence significantly affect the
   physical, mental, and behavioral health of transgender adults and drive
   disparities in access to health insurance and adequate care. To improve
   these outcomes and the experiences of transgender patients in health
   care settings, it is critical to adopt both robust nondiscrimination
   laws and in-practice policies that are affirming, inclusive, and
   culturally competent throughout all areas of the U.S. health care
   system. Given the current slate of discriminatory and harmful
   state-level bills that seek to strip transgender youth and adults of
   their rights and access to health care, fully implementing these
   protections is vital and will have life-saving consequences. The
   current administration's executive actions to combat discrimination on
   the basis of SOGI^244 and to advance support for underserved
   communities^245 offer opportunities to facilitate these changes. The
   time for the federal agencies and health providers to act is now.

Appendix A

   This report draws from original CAP analyses of three data sources,
   outlined below.

1. CAP's nationally representative survey of LGBTQI+ Americans, conducted in
June 2020

   This sample includes data from 1,528 LGBTQI+-identifying individuals,
   including 121 transgender individuals, collected with assistance from
   NORC at the University of Chicago using their AmeriSpeak panel. A
   sample of U.S. adults ages 18 and older who self-identified as LGBTQI+
   was selected for this study, and this sample has been weighted to
   account for both U.S. population characteristics and survey
   nonresponse. The full results of the study, along with a detailed
   overview of the methodology, are on file with the authors. For
   additional information on survey results, please see CAP's related
   report^246 and interactive.^247 All statistics from CAP's survey
   comparing transgender respondents with cisgender LGBTQI+ respondents
   are significant at the 0.05 level.

2. The 2019 edition of the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System

   This survey is a collaborative project between the CDC, U.S. states,
   and participating territories. It is conducted by phone among U.S.
   adults ages 18 years and older and asks a series of questions regarding
   health-related risk behaviors, diseases, and chronic conditions. The
   survey is comprised of a core set of questions as well as additional
   modules that states have the option of including. Currently, 31 states
   and one territory have opted to include questions to ascertain an
   individual's gender identity, creating a sample of 232,088 cisgender
   individuals and 955 transgender individuals. This data is weighted to
   account for probability of selection, nonresponse bias, and U.S.
   population characteristics. All statistics comparing transgender
   respondents with cisgender respondents are significant at the 0.05
   level. Data and a detailed methodology are on file with the authors and
   available publicly via the CDC.^248

3. The TransPop study, conducted by the Williams Institute, Columbia
University, Harvard University, and the Fenway Institute at Fenway Health

   TransPop is the first nationally representative survey of transgender
   individuals in the United States. Conducted over the phone and mail by
   Gallup from 2016 to 2018, the TransPop study was a national probability
   sample of 1,436 adults over the age of 18, including 274 transgender
   individuals and 1,040 cisgender heterosexual individuals. The sample
   has been weighted to account for both survey nonresponse and U.S.
   population characteristics. For a full overview of the methodology
   behind TransPop, please see the Methodology section of the Williams
   Institute's overview report on TransPop.^249

   The Williams Institute released a comprehensive overview of results
   from its TransPop and Generations surveys in June 2021.^250 This
   overview included the vast majority of statistics for transgender
   respondents to TransPop cited in this report. Where a statistic cited
   here was taken from this overview, an endnote is included to account
   for it. In addition, Feldman and others recently released a study
   comparing health and health care access of transgender and cisgender
   individuals, also cited in this report and an important resource for
   providing a thorough overview of differences in health outcomes.^251
   Where TransPop statistics have no corresponding endnote, as is the case
   with statistics for cisgender heterosexual respondents to TransPop, the
   statistic comes from original CAP data analysis. All comparisons
   between transgender and cisgender heterosexual individuals from
   TransPop are significant at the 0.1 level.

CAP Survey Data on LGBTQI+ Experiences

   The Center for American Progress has worked with NORC at the University
   of Chicago to design a comprehensive, nationally representative survey
   that collects data on the lives, attitudes, and experiences of LGBTQI+
   Americans. The survey results reveal LGBTQI+ communities' experiences
   in a wide range of situations in both the public and private
   spheres--including discrimination, physical and mental well-being,
   medical care, the workforce, education, and government services. It
   also breaks down participants' responses along demographic lines such
   as race and ethnicity, gender identity, age, disability status, and
   educational attainment. Survey results play a critical role in better
   understanding these groups' realities and informing policy responses to
   disparities as well as paths forward for potential future research.

Transgender-Specific Issues

The Choices: Physical Appearance

   This section describes
   choices related to physical appearance:
     * Gender expression.
     * Hormones.
     * Surgery.

Gender expression

   Gender expression, as opposed to gender identity, is what is on the
   outside. It is how people express their gender to others.

   All people make daily choices about what clothes to wear; whether and
   how to use or not use accessories, jewelry, and/or makeup; and how
   their hair is cut or styled. Most people have a specific look or style
   that is personally comfortable. This may also include how individuals
   walk, sit, or carry themselves.

   In the United States, women and men often are expected to make
   appearance-related choices from mutually exclusive sets of options. For
   example, although women may wear feminine-tailored clothing, use
   makeup, have a feminine hairstyle, and act "femininely," these gender
   expressions are very rarely considered acceptable for men. Other
   examples include separate women's and men's clothing departments,
   jewelry and watch display cases, and hygiene-related store shelves.

   A growing number of non-transgender individuals are breaking
   traditional gender norms. Male goth youth, for example, wear eyeliner
   and fingernail polish; business women wear pantsuits without makeup or
   jewelry; metrosexual men use moisturizing products and get manicures.
   Although gender expression is less rigid with each passing year, in
   large part expectations to conform to the stereotypes remain in place.

   Transgender people may decide to consistently present as male or female
   in alignment with societal norms. They may also deliberately choose
   both male and female gender expressions and thus have mixed, gender
   non-conforming, or genderfluid presentation. Some are more fluid about
   their gender expression, which they may change from day to day, hour to
   hour, or setting to setting either because they feel they have to
   (e.g., an individual chooses not to transition at work) or because they
   want to.
   What's That Mean?
     * FTM
     * MTF

   Some transgender people express gender in very traditional or overt
   ways to better "pass" as the gender with which they identify. For
   example, a male-to-female (MTF) transgender person may always wear
   skirts and stereotypically feminine blouses, paired with matching
   earrings and pristine makeup. A female-to-male (FTM) individual may
   wear a pressed oxford shirt and tie, dress pants and buffed shoes, and
   neatly trimmed short hair. In these cases, there is an intentional
   effort to send very clear, gendered messages to others.

   Often, as people are in the process of figuring out what feels most
   comfortable for themselves, they may experiment with styles and looks.
   They may later relax into more comfortable clothes, or clothes that
   reflect their own personal sense of style, rather than basing their
   choices on rigid cultural norms.

   Body image can play a role in how people express their gender.
   Transgender people generally have an even more uncomfortable or
   negative relationship with their bodies than non-transgender people.
   Some create a literal armor to hide or alter their bodies or to create
   a different bodily contour:
     * Some FTMs (or other people on the trans-masculine spectrum)&#151;

     * Bind their chests.
     * Wear baggy or multiple layers of clothing to help flatten the
       appearance of their chest.
     * Wear self-made or store-bought penile prosthetics.
     * Use prosthetics to allow them to urinate while standing.
     * Slouch or intentionally gain weight to add mass to their
       midsection, altering their feminine contour.

     Some MTFs (or other people on the trans-feminine spectrum)&#151;
     * Use breast or hip forms to create a more feminine contour.
     * "Gaff" or "tuck" (i.e., pull back their genitals to create a
       smoother line).
     * Wear wigs.
     * Dress in a highly stereotypical feminine way to create an outward
       appearance of undeniable femaleness.

   Safety can also be a major component of how gender is expressed. More
   detail about safety is found in the Passing section of this e-pub.

Hormones

   Some transgender people&#151;but by no means all&#151;use hormones as
   part of their medical transition. According to the National Center for
   Transgender Equality's (NCTE) groundbreaking study of 6,450 transgender
   individuals, 62 percent of respondents have had some hormone therapy
   and 23 percent hope to have it in the future.^10 Hormones are available
   in injectable, pill, patch, and gel/cream formats.

   Hormones help shift bodies into a more traditionally masculine or
   feminine form. Using testosterone, for example, can deepen the voice,
   activate facial and body hair growth, redistribute fat, cause the
   clitoris to enlarge, and may stimulate male pattern balding. Vaginal
   tissue typically becomes more fragile and less elastic and may not
   lubricate easily. The vaginal opening may become smaller and tighter,
   especially if the person does not use their vagina for consensual
   sexual penetration. Testosterone use usually, but not always, results
   in the cessation of menstrual cycles and renders the individual
   infertile. Using estrogen, progesterone, and anti-androgens can cause
   breast growth, reduce body hair, redistribute body fat, soften the
   skin, cause some loss of muscle mass, and increase the risk of blood
   clots, particularly following surgery and in people who smoke. Although
   mood swings are a typical side effect of hormones in the first few
   years of use, people who use them frequently report that hormones make
   them calmer and happier.^11

   Because some of the changes from hormone use are permanent, some
   transgender people stop using hormones once they have achieved specific
   physical goals. Others stop for health reasons or because they become
   unable to afford hormones (which may not be covered by health
   insurance, even for those who have insurance). Others continue lifelong
   use, which is generally recommended for anyone who no longer generates
   their own hormones due to a hysterectomy (removal of the ovaries and
   uterus) or orchiectomy (removal of the testes), or due to age (when
   hormone levels naturally decline).

   People can acquire hormones from a health care provider or
   clinic&#151;the safest method&#151;but they may also get them on the
   street, from friends, or online (frequently without any medical
   supervision or monitoring). Non-physician prescribed hormones are
   relatively common due to a lack of access to health care, an inability
   to afford physician visits and routine laboratory tests, a preference
   not to see a physician, or a preference to avoid or an inability to
   afford psychotherapy, which a physician may require prior to
   prescribing hormones.^12

Silicone

   Some MTFs inject silicone to feminize their bodies. Silicone use is
   particularly prevalent among MTFs involved in the sex trade because it
   creates a feminine appearance without the use of hormones, which may
   limit erectile function and reduce their employment options.^13

   Although injected silicone has an immediate outcome, it also carries
   many serious health risks, including migration of the silicone away
   from the desired area, systemic illness, and even death.^14 In
   addition, because injection often happens in peer-based group settings
   and in less-than-sterile environments, needles may be re-used or
   shared, increasing the risk of acquiring HIV, hepatitis, and other
   blood-borne infections.

   Note: FTMs may also use silicone to alter the shape and contour of
   their bodies.

   If people acquire hormones through a health care provider, that
   provider should monitor the individuals' laboratory results and
   physical wellness. Many providers adhere to a standard of care to guide
   their treatment of transgender patients, which requires that a mental
   health professional also be involved.^15 Most standards of care require
   that transgender clients participate in therapy for a time, typically 3
   months to 1 year, after which the mental health care provider will
   write a letter stating that the client is ready to start medical
   treatment. This "gatekeeping" model can create additional challenges.
   For example, transgender people who visit mental health professionals
   may omit certain details about their lives out of fear that they will
   be denied the letter required by the standard of care. Past traumas,
   current mental health issues, or drug or alcohol use are generally
   known to have been used as justification for withholding these letters.
   A growing number of LGBT community health clinics and individual
   providers, however, are moving from standards of care to informed
   consent models of care, giving both transgender patients and providers
   more flexibility, autonomy, and control over the health care
   process.^16

   The risks associated with medically supervised hormone use are in line
   with the risks of many other medications. Routine monitoring, moderate
   dosing, a healthy lifestyle (e.g., exercise, healthy diet, adequate
   rest, low-to-moderate stress), and well-managed medical conditions
   (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, other common or rare conditions)
   help to minimize the risks associated with hormone use.

   Economics, access to medical care, and access to physicians who are
   willing to prescribe hormones often influence how and whether people
   obtain hormones as a part of their medical transition.
   Back to Top

Surgery

   Non-transgender people frequently believe there is one "transgender
   surgery," which involves the genitals. The reality is that there is no
   "one" surgery and that multiple options or combinations of surgeries
   can help people change their bodies to be more closely in line with
   their gender identity. As with hormone use, health care providers
   operating under standards of care may require their transgender clients
   to participate in therapy before surgery. In fact, surgeons
   specializing in gender-related surgeries often require letters from two
   mental health professionals rather than just one.

   The following data on surgeries were taken from the National
   Transgender Discrimination Survey conducted in 2011^17:
     * The most common FTM surgeries are mastectomy or chest
       reconstruction (41 percent) and hysterectomy (20 percent). Few have
       phalloplasty (construction of a penis) (2 percent) or other genital
       surgery (e.g., metoidioplasty and/or construction of testes) (3
       percent) because of their high cost and frequent complications, and
       dissatisfaction with the results.
     * MTF surgeries can involve breast augmentation (18 percent), facial
       feminization surgery (e.g., creating a less prominent brow or chin,
       shaving the Adams apple), vaginoplasty (creating a vagina) (20
       percent), and/or removal of the testes (21 percent). Because of the
       danger of attracting anti-transgender violence in public, some
       transgender women consider breast augmentation and facial
       feminization surgeries higher priorities than genital surgery.

Non-Suicidal Self-Injury

   Cutting, or non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as a way of coping with
   abuse and stress is common among transgender people. In a study of 977
   individuals, almost 42 percent had a history of NSSI, as compared to
   4-38 percent in the non-transgender population. FTMs had substantially
   higher rates of NSSI. Of transgender people who were prevented from
   transitioning (denied letters for hormones or surgery), 50 percent had
   a history of NSSI.^18

   Genital surgery, as noted above, is far more common for MTFs than FTMs.
   The difference in function and aesthetics may be among the reasons for
   this disparity, as well as the difference in cost for vaginoplasty
   (cheaper) versus phalloplasty (much more expensive).

   On rare occasions, some transgender people who have been unable to
   access surgeries due to cost and/or surgeons' refusals to operate have
   attempted self-surgery to remove their breasts, penis, or testicles.

   Contrary to popular belief, many transgender people do not feel the
   need to surgically alter their bodies. For that reason, combined with
   prohibitive costs, lack of access, and worries about functionality and
   aesthetics, FORGE believes that most transgender people do not have
   gender-related surgery. This underlying belief is supported by the
   National Transgender Discrimination Survey's broad sample of
   transgender individuals and their experiences and desires with/for
   surgery.^19

   Transgender is a term used to describe people whose gender identity
   does not conform with the gender they were assigned at birth. A person
   designated male at birth who identifies as female is a transgender
   woman, while a person designated female at birth who identifies as male
   is a transgender man.

   In recent years, transgender has become an umbrella term that includes
   not only people who are binary (male or female) but also those who are
   non-binary or gender-non-conforming.

   Gender affirmation, or the process of aligning one's outward expression
   of gender with one's inward sense of gender, is central to the
   transgender identity. Medical treatments or surgery may be involved,
   but not always.

   This article explains what it means to be transgender, including the
   terminology used and how to use it correctly. It also describes the
   process of gender affirmation and some of the serious challenges faced
   by transgender people today.

What It Means to Be Transgender

   Transgender traditionally means to identify as male if you were
   assigned female at birth or to identify as female if you were assigned
   male at birth. And, to many, that remains the definition of
   "transgender," described on the male-female binary.

   But not everyone sees gender in the same way.

   Those who are non-binary view gender on a spectrum where roles and
   expectations aren't automatically assigned based on what genitals a
   person is born with. As such, a non-binary person may identify as male
   and female, as neither male nor female, or as their own unique gender
   (described by some as the "third gender").

   In the current vernacular, non-binary people may fall under the
   "transgender umbrella" when they consciously move away from expected
   gender roles and align themselves, their presentation, and sometimes
   their bodies with their own gender identity.

   In the end, gender identity is one's internal sense of gender even if
   that means no gender at all. Examples include:
     * Agender: Identifying with no gender
     * Bigender: Identifying with both male and female gender
       characteristics
     * Cisgender: Identifying with the sex you were assigned at birth
     * Genderfluid or genderqueer: Shifting between genders or outside of
       society's expectations of gender
     * Pangender or polygender: Displaying or experiencing parts of all
       genders
     * Third Spirit: An umbrella term that describes different sexualities
       and genders in Indigenous Native American people

Gender Identity vs. Sexual Orientation

   Gender and sex are not the same thing, and neither are gender identity
   and sexual orientation.

   Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender, which can
   correspond to a person's assigned sex or differ from it. Sexual
   orientation is a person's identity in relation to the gender or
   genders they are sexually attracted to.

Gender Affirmation and Gender Expression

   Whether binary or non-binary, the one characteristic that connects all
   transgender people is that the gender assigned to them at birth does
   not match their own internal sense of gender identity.

   This mismatch can be felt from as early as three to five years in some
   transgender children. Others may not recognize it until puberty when
   changes in their bodies create a palpable sense of unease about their
   gender and all that implies. Others still may not recognize this until
   later in life.

   This uneasiness is referred to as gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is
   not a psychological illness. It simply describes distress caused by the
   misalignment of a person's assigned gender and gender identity.

   In response to gender dysphoria, a transgender person may pursue gender
   affirmation in its different forms to align their gender identity
   (their inward sense of gender) with their gender expression (their
   outward expression of their gender).

   Gender affirmation (formerly known as gender transitioning) can include
   one or all of the following:
     * Social affirmation, which may involve changing your name and
       pronouns, your manner (such as the way you sit and talk), your
       appearance (such as your clothing and hair), and the washroom you
       use
     * Legal affirmation, which may involve changing your name and gender
       on your driver's license, birth certificate, bank accounts,
       passport, medical records, and other governmental and
       non-governmental records
     * Medical affirmation, which may involve gender-affirming hormone
       therapy and gender-affirming surgeries (such as breast
       augmentation, vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, orchiectomy, or facial
       feminization)

Do All Transgender People Have Surgery?

   Despite what many people think, a person does not have to undergo
   medical treatments to be transgender. Social and/or legal affirmation
   may be far more important to some people.

   While many transgender people will take hormones to align their
   physical expression with their gender identity, there are many who
   don't and have no desire to.

Terminology and Appropriate Usage

   Transgender is an adjective (as in "he is a transgender man"). It is
   not used as a noun (such as "he is a transgender")" or a verb ("he is
   transgendered").

   "Trans" is often used as a shorthand for transgender, so it is usually
   acceptable to describe a transgender man as a trans man and a
   transgender woman as a trans woman.

   If someone identifies as transgender, you would typically use the
   pronouns "he" and "him" for a transgender man and "she" and "her" for a
   transgender woman. Even so, non-binary or gender-non-conforms people
   may prefer "them" and "they" or other pronouns, so ask first if you are
   unsure.

   If in doubt, err on the side of caution by offering your pronouns first
   and then asking the person what pronouns they use.

   Mistakes can occur, but to intentionally or repeatedly use the wrong
   pronouns is a disrespectful act known as misgendering.

   Equally disrespectful is calling someone by their "dead name" (their
   name prior to gender affirmation) rather than their "affirmed name."
   This is true even if you're a family member or have grown up with that
   person.

Terms to Avoid

   There are other terms that have been displaced because they
   mischaracterize was being transgender is about. Others still are
   considered offensive and should never be used.

   These include:
     * Biological sex: "Biological" is often construed to mean authentic
       as in "biologically male" or "biologically female." It also
       suggests that genitals are physical and gender identity is somehow
       psychological.
     * Gender-confirming: A transgender person does not need to confirm or
       "prove" their gender. A transgender person affirms their gender by
       asserting their authentic self. Gender-affirming surgery is
       preferred, for example, over gender-confirming surgery.
     * Gender reassignment: In the same vein, a transgender person's
       gender is not changed or reassigned. This is especially true if you
       are non-binary and identify as neither male nor female.
     * Sex change: This is an outdated and largely offensive term that
       suggests that being transgender is about changing one's genitals.
     * Transsexual: This is another outdated and offensive term that
       equates transgender identity with surgery, such as when describing
       a "pre-op transsexual" and "post-op transsexual."
     * Tranny, She-Male, or She-He: These are defamatory terms used to
       dehumanize transgender people.
     * Transgenderism: This is a term used by anti-trans activists that
       suggests that there is a movement to "recruit" or "push" people
       toward becoming transgender.

Discrimination and Transphobia

   It is estimated that about 0.5% of adults in the United States (1.3
   million) and 1.4% of youth between the ages of 13 and 17 years (or
   300,000) identify as transgender.

   Studies have shown that being transgender in the United States is
   fraught with challenges, including transphobia and discrimination in
   all realms of employment, education, healthcare, safety, and daily
   living.

   The National Transgender Discrimination Survey is the largest survey to
   assess the experiences of transgender people in the United States. It
   has been performed twice--first in 2008 with 6,450 respondents and then
   in 2013 with more than 27,000

   Both reports described high rates of discrimination across every facet
   of life. Discrimination took the form of everything from verbal
   harassment to sexual assault, and many individuals were forced to leave
   school or jobs as a result of those experiences.

   Transgender individuals also reported many experiences of
   discrimination in health care. Many individuals were denied access to
   gender-affirming medical and surgical care.

   Perhaps even more disturbing, numerous people reported being denied
   access to emergency care and general medical care as well as verbal and
   physical harassment in healthcare spaces.

   Because of this, many transgender people report avoiding medical care,
   for fear of experiencing additional discrimination or abuse. Others
   report avoiding care because they lacked financial or other resources.

   Among the key statistics:
     * One in six trans children has had to leave or change schools due to
       mistreatment.
     * One in four trans children has been physically attacked.
     * One in eight trans children has been sexually assaulted.
     * Nearly half of all trans people were sexually assaulted over the
       course of their lifetime.
     * One in three trans adults has been fired, denied a promotion, or
       experienced mistreatment in the workplace due to their gender
       expression.
     * One in three trans people has experienced mistreatment in
       healthcare, ranging from the refusal of service to verbal,
       physical, or sexual abuse.

   Discrimination is even worse for transgender people of color, who may
   experience bias based on both their skin color and their gender
   identity.

   The survey found that Latinx, American Indian, multiracial, and Black
   respondents were more than three times as likely as the general U.S.
   population to be living in poverty.

How to Be an Ally

   Gender diversity is a normal part of a functioning society and has been
   reported throughout history. Although transgender individuals have an
   increased risk of certain negative health outcomes, research suggests
   that this does not reflect any inherent issue with being transgender.
   Instead, it reflects the minority stress related to being part of a
   society that may not be accepting.

   Indeed, research suggests that one of the most important factors
   associated with the health of transgender people is access to an
   affirming environment and desired medical care. This is particularly
   true for transgender children and adolescents, who have been shown to
   do as well as their cisgender peers when their families are supportive
   and accepting.

   While not all transgender individuals are interested in medical or
   surgical affirmation, all people need health care at some point during
   their lives. Therefore, it is important to make all healthcare
   facilities safe and affirming for people of diverse genders. Lack of
   access to affirming health care is a risk factor for health concerns
   for transgender people of all ages.

   The gay rights movement in the US has been gaining traction for the
   past several decades. From the overturn of the Defense of Marriage Act
   in 1996 to allowing trans athletes to compete in athletics, major
   strides have been made. However, these steps forward do not guarantee
   the protection of gay rights, as is demonstrated in the anit-queer
   legislation widely called the "Don't Say Gay" bill. This bill has the
   potential to do significant harm to students, and may not be the most
   effective way to protect children from damaging content.

Introduction

   The Parental Rights in Education Bill introduced by the Florida House
   of Representatives, commonly known as the "Don't Say Gay" bill,
   `prohibits classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender
   identity in certain grade levels.' The bill says that `a school
   district may not encourage classroom discussion about sexual
   orientation or gender identity in primary grade levels or in a manner
   that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for
   students.'

   This language is vague, but implies that some content regarding gender
   identity and sexuality may be taught if it is deemed `age-appropriate'.
   This may allow teaching that actively opposes LGBTQ+ identities, and
   leads many to question whether the purpose of this bill is to protect
   children from `ideology', or if it is simply an attempt to embed
   conservative views about gender and sexuality in children early in
   their development.

   Also included in the bill are regulations that dictate that if a
   student is receiving resources at school for their mental or physical
   health, a parent must be notified. Supporters of the bill state that it
   will facilitate family discussions and allow parents to have more input
   in what is taught in schools, while opponents express that the bill
   will harm LGBTQ+ families and damage student's rights.

   Pointed Summary
     * The Parental Rights in Education Bill limits discussion of sexual
       orientation and gender identity in schools
     * Concerns over the bill focus primarily on the potential harm it
       will do to LGBTQ+ students and families

   Current Stances

   The history of anti-gay legislation is extensive, and the Parental
   Rights in Education Bill has only been the latest addition. Anti-gay
   legislation is not confined to laws that mention LGBTQ+ individuals.
   Religious exemption laws provide citizens the opportunity to deny
   services to those who identify as LGBTQ+.

   After Elane Photography v. Willock, a 2013 New Mexico Supreme Court
   ruling that applied an anti-discrimination law when a photography
   business refused to photograph a same-sex wedding, Arizona's Senate
   enacted Bill 1062 stating that "state action shall not substantially
   burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from
   a rule of general applicability."

   Similar laws have been passed, such as the 1996 Defense of Marriage
   Act, stating that "the word 'spouse' refers only to a person of the
   opposite sex who is a husband or a wife," denying recognition and
   rights for same-sex couples.

   Tried Policy

   Many legislators have plans to institute the Parental Rights in
   Education bill outside of Florida, in states such as Georgia and
   Louisiana. Similar legislation has been enacted in different states in
   recent years, restricting discussions and history about LGBTQ+
   identities and issues. In Tennessee, the House introduced a bill
   banning materials that "promote, normalize, support, or address
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) lifestyles" in K-12
   schools. Another in Kansas, House Bill No. 2662 labels "homosexuality"
   as a Class B misdemeanor in schools.

Policy Questions

Policy Problem

   Stakeholders

   Most obviously, this bill will affect students, as it removes discourse
   around certain topics from their classrooms, and enforces disclosure of
   information around their mental and physical health to parents.

   Parents are another stakeholder, as the bill seeks to `reinforce the
   fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing
   and control of their children'. Some parents may want more control over
   what their children are taught, and specifically that it conforms to
   their own beliefs.

   The bill will also affect teachers and schools, who will be under a set
   of enforceable obligations regarding what they can and cannot tell
   children, and may face legal consequences if they get it wrong.

   Risks of Indifference

   The bill requires that parents are informed of and involved in
   `critical decisions affecting student's mental, emotional, or physical
   well-being', as well as to notify parents of `healthcare services'.
   There is concern that children of parents hostile to their potential
   gender identity or sexual orientation will be `outed' to their parents
   as soon as they begin to ask these questions, and face degrading and
   harmful treatment such as conversion therapies.

   Nonpartisan Reasoning

   Those in favor of the bill argue that it helps to address the problem
   of removing what they view as progressive ideology from the classroom.
   They argue that young children should not be exposed to views around
   sex and gender. Governor De Santis, a proponent of the bill, argues
   `First graders should not have woke gender ideology [sic] imposed in
   their curriculum, and that is what we are standing for.'

   The Senator supporting the bill also says that the bill serves to
   address `social engineering that could result in more children
   identifying as gay or transgender.' These speak to a widespread belief
   that children are being corrupted by learning about progressive views
   on sex and gender. When signing the bill, DeSantis said `We will make
   sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education,
   not an indoctrination.'

   The bill claims to `reinforce (the) fundamental right of parents to
   make decisions regarding upbringing & control of their children',
   allowing parents to sue schools if they feel the provisions of the bill
   have been breached. For those in favor of the bill, this provides
   parents with more of a say in their childrens' upbringing, allowing
   them to shield their children from material they view as harmful, and
   to raise their children as they see fit.

   However, removing this content from classrooms may do more harm than
   good. Campaigners against the bill argue that removing access to
   information about gender and sexuality is likely to harm children by
   not providing them with the support they need if they begin to question
   aspects of their identity.

   LGBTQ+ children already face high suicide rates, discrimination and
   abuse, and alienating them from discussion about their identities from
   the outset may compound the ostracisation and mental health
   difficulties they face. It may also lead these children to turn to
   other sources for information, such as the internet, which can lead
   them to explore content far beyond their age level, and also to
   potentially harmful information about their own identity.

   More than just erasing progressive notions of gender and sexuality,
   Brandon Wolf, press secretary of LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Florida,
   argues that the bill may further stigmatize LGBTQ+ students. He said
   `suggesting sexual orientation or gender identity is `contagious' is
   not based in fact.' As well as stigmatizing these students socially, it
   may cause them internal harm too.

   As mentioned above, the vague language of the bill, such as the
   `age-appropriate' teaching provision, suggests that children will be
   taught content that actively reinforces conservative views on gender,
   sexuality, and the family. This may cause students to internalize
   these notions, leading to mental health issues if they do come to
   question their own identities.

   Finally, there is also a concern that teachers will be placed in
   difficult positions. When students come to them to ask questions
   relating to their sexuality or gender, teachers will be legally obliged
   to give answers that, as demonstrated above, may be harmful to these
   childrens' development.

   Furthermore, these teachers are at risk of being sued by parents for
   not disclosing these conversations, even if they fear the children
   would be placed at risk should their conversations be revealed to
   schools and parents. This removes the ability of schools to care for
   their students. Whilst some may celebrate this, arguing that schools
   should not raise their children, others are concerned that this will
   leave children vulnerable and without a sufficient level of care.

Policy Options

   The policy of Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill--also
   referred to as the "Don't Say Gay" bill-- is vague, with the
   implementation beginning with "notifying a student's parent" when their
   child is receiving mental health services. Additionally, parents could
   "bring action against the school district...and seek injunctive relief"
   if the school district does not enforce the new bill, with the court
   awarding damages and "reasonable attorney fees and court costs" to the
   parent, at the school district's expense.

   The cost to the government is minimal, as the schools themselves would
   incur the costs of the lawsuits brought forth if the parents were
   awarded damages. But schools already struggling for funding may find
   lawsuits very difficult to fund, potentially compromising the quality
   of education they provide.

   Governor Ron DeSantis signed the bill into law on March 28th, scheduled
   to be implemented on July 1st.

Conclusion

   Florida's `Don't Say Gay' bill is the latest installment in the US' so
   called `culture wars'. Proponents believe it will protect their
   children from `woke gender ideology', preventing an `indoctrination' in
   ideas that gender is socially constructed, or that divergence from
   heterosexuality is acceptable and normal. They argue it will return
   control to parents over how their children are raised, and what they
   are taught. Advocates hope it will prevent their children from
   questioning gender and sexuality norms, divergence from which many of
   these proponents view as morally wrong.

   Those against the bill argue that it is nothing more than a reactionary
   moral panic against progressive social ideas, and will cause
   significant harm to many children.

   There is concern that removing open discussion on these issues will
   lead children contemplating their identities to more harmful content on
   the internet, to ostracize them from their peers, and to internalize
   conceptions of themselves as wrong or prohibited, leading to mental
   health issues.

   The vague language of the bill suggests teaching contrary to liberal
   progressive ideas will be allowed, which may further compound mental
   health problems. The privacy provisions of the bill may put students at
   risk, and limit the abilities of teachers to care for children and
   schools to provide good education.

   transgender, term self-applied by persons whose gender identity varies
   from that traditionally associated with their apparent biological sex
   at birth. In its original and narrower sense, transgender referred to
   males and females who respectively gender-identify as females and
   males. In a later and broader sense, it has come to designate persons
   whose gender identities incorporate behaviours and traits traditionally
   associated with the opposite sex. Transgender persons may thus include
   transsexuals, transgenderists (in one usage of the term, persons who
   gender-identify with the opposite sex but who choose not to undergo
   sex-reassignment surgery or hormone treatments), and androgynes
   (biologically or psychologically androgynous persons), among other
   groups. In its broader sense, transgender is closely related to the
   more-recent term genderqueer, which is self-applied by persons who are
   either transgender or who have no gender, a third (neither male nor
   female) gender, or a fluctuating gender.

   In part because there is no universally accepted definition of
   transgender (different researchers use the term in different ways), it
   is uncertain how many transgender persons there are. Estimates in the
   United States, based on the broad definition used in this article, have
   varied from less than 1 percent to more than 3 percent of the
   population in the early 21st century.

Sex, gender, and sexual orientation

   The notion of transgender presupposes fundamental distinctions between
   the concepts of sex, gender, and sexual orientation (see human sexual
   behaviour). Whereas sex is a biological category, gender refers to the
   set of traits and behaviours that are traditionally associated with a
   particular sex. A person who is transgender experiences and expresses a
   disjunction between sex and gender. Sexual orientation, in contrast, is
   defined in terms of the sexes or genders to which a person is sexually,
   emotionally, or romantically attracted. It is a widespread but mistaken
   assumption that transgender persons are necessarily homosexual (i.e.,
   attracted to members of the sex that they were assigned at birth).
   Although some are homosexual, others are heterosexual or bisexual or do
   not identify with any particular sexual orientation.

Theoretical background

   Various theories of gender have been proposed as explanations of the
   experience of transgender persons. In addition to the concepts of sex
   and gender, those of gender identity and gender expression are
   particularly important for such theories. Gender identity refers to a
   person's self-identification as male or female or as something in
   between or outside of those categories. Gender expression refers to the
   behaviour through which one expresses one's gender identity--e.g., by
   using certain pronouns or wearing certain kinds of clothing or having a
   particular hairstyle. Whereas gender identity is not something that
   others can view, gender expression is publicly visible.

   The main theories of gender are essentialism, social constructionism,
   and performativity. Essentialists place emphasis on biological
   characteristics, arguing that a person's gender identity is fixed at
   birth, whether or not it corresponds to biological sex. Essentialism is
   thus opposed to the view that gender identity is entirely socially
   constructed--i.e., a product of social or societal influences. The
   central case in need of explanation, according to essentialists, is
   that of persons who report having always (for as long as they can
   remember) felt that they belonged to the sex opposite the one that they
   were assigned at birth. Such experiences are typical of transsexuals,
   who feel the need to change their sex to match the gender identity they
   feel they have always had.

   Social constructionism, as the term suggests, is the view that gender
   is socially constructed. That gender is socially constructed is shown,
   according to constructionists, by the fact that the traits and
   behaviours traditionally associated with the male or female sex have
   varied over time and across cultures, which would not be the case if
   gender were innate. It is important to note that essentialism and
   social constructivism, as those theories are defined in this article,
   are not necessarily inconsistent, insofar as they aim to explain
   different (though obviously related) things: the one concerns the
   supposed biological origin of gender identity (one's
   self-identification as male or female), the other the supposed social
   or societal origin of gender (the traits and behaviours that make up
   the masculine or the feminine). It is entirely possible that the former
   is innate and the latter largely, if not entirely, learned, in the
   broad sense of being instilled.

   As to sex, some social constructivists claim that it too is not
   biologically given but rather pronounced by medical professionals whose
   role it is to place infants into one or the other category at birth. A
   prominent defender of that view is the American philosopher Judith
   Butler, who is also known as a developer of the performative theory of
   gender.

   An extension of social constructivism is the performative theory, or
   performativity, which holds that gender is a "performance" that people
   undertake on a daily basis, even if only unconsciously. In particular,
   gender is not the expression of an underlying essence or nature,
   whether based on sex or on gender identity. It is rather a series of
   acts whose constant repetition creates the illusion that an underlying
   nature exists. According to Butler, gender "is performatively
   constituted by the very `expressions' that are said to be its results."

   Transgender is an umbrella term for anyone whose internal experience of
   gender does not match the sex they were assigned at birth (normally
   based on primary and secondary sex charateristics). Transgender people
   may experience discomfort or distress due to their gender not aligning
   with their sex, and therefore wish to transition to being the gender
   they identify with.

   Some transgender people feel this way from a very young age, while
   others go through a period of questioning before realizing they are
   transgender. Transgender people can be any gender. They can have any
   sexual orientation, express their gender through their appearance in
   any way, and may or may not fit into society's views of gender.

   People whose sex corresponds to their gender identity are referred to
   as cisgender.

Terminology

   There are a wide range of terms used in reference to transgender
   people, and the definitions of words often vary over time, or between
   different groups of people. it is always important to check in with
   individuals which words they prefer to use rather than to assign them
   labels they may not be comfortable with.

   Generally, all discussion of transgender people is focused on gender
   identity. For example, a trans man is someone who views themselves as a
   man and was assigned female at birth. It is his internal experience (as
   a man) which determines how he is described, not the way he is seen by
   society. Similarly, a trans woman views herself as a woman and was
   assigned male at birth. This can confuse those who are new to
   discussions of transgender identity, but it's an important distinction.

   This distinction is based on the understanding that gender and sex are
   separate, where 'gender' means internal experience, and 'sex' means the
   attributes of the body. Therefore, a woman (gender) can have a penis
   and XY chromosomes (sex), but this does not affect her self-identity as
   a woman, except for the possibility that she was raised to see herself
   as a man.

   Terms such as "male-bodied" and "female-bodied" are often seen as
   inappropriate because they confuse gender with sex. A trans woman is a
   woman, and therefore her body is female because it belongs to a woman.
   Instead, the terminology "assigned male/female/intersex at birth" is
   used to indicate whether a person is born male or female. This
   terminology also acknowledges that gender varies between societies, and
   some cultures recognize three or more genders.

   It is worth noting that some people are born with sex characteristics
   that cannot be easily classified as either male or female. This is
   known as being intersex, and many intersex individuals are unaware of
   their condition. Those who are not intersex are referred to as dyadic.

   Other important concepts are the gender binary and the gender spectrum.

   The gender binary refers to the idea that there are only two genders,
   man and woman, and that everyone can be categorized as one or the
   other. However, many people feel that their gender identity is
   non-binary and cannot be described as either of these identities.
   Another term used for people who fall outside the gender binary is
   genderqueer, which is often used to imply a desire to change the norms
   of gender.

   The gender spectrum on the other hand is the idea that gender isn't
   binary but a continuum. At it simplest is a line between male and
   female. The next step up is a 2D pane with male and female on the axis.
   The next step is adding in Aporagenders(genders not related to male or
   female) each on their own axis. The final step is Gender Field theory
   where gender is a N-dimensional field. For more on the different
   theories of gender see Models of gender identity.

Transition

   Transition is any action a transgender person takes in order for the
   external world to better recognize and reflect their internal gender.
   This can range from asking people to use different names and pronouns,
   to a change in dress or appearance, to extensive surgery. The three
   main forms of transition are social, legal, and medical, although all
   of these are broad categories which can reflect dozens of different
   possible actions.

   Transgender people often have dysphoria (feelings of distress) arising
   from their sex characteristics not matching their self-image and/or
   being seen and treated as the wrong gender (misgendered). This
   dysphoria may be referred to by the medical term of Gender Identity
   Disorder, for which the correct treatment is considered to be
   transition, accompanied by any necessary support to achieve the desired
   state.

   Some transgender people have gender euphoria (feelings of elation) from
   making or thinking about their body, gender expression and/or being
   seen and treated as prefered gender.

   Every transgender person has different desires for what they want (or
   do not want) to include in their transition, including surgery and
   other medical procedures. Transgender people who do not plan to have
   surgery are sometimes referred to as non-op; transsexual is sometimes
   used to refer to only those who do. It is important not to make
   assumptions about what is, was or will be involved in any individual
   person's transition.

   Some transgender people are aware of their condition as children and
   begin transitioning then, such as by taking puberty blockers to delay
   the development of sex characteristics until they are old enough to be
   allowed to medically transition. However, many attempt to reconcile
   themselves with living as their assigned gender, and only transition
   later in life when they realize they are not happy with the way things
   are. This may involve a period of questioning in which a person is
   uncertain of their gender identity, and wishes to explore before
   settling on a label for themselves.

   Even after transition, transgender people may not want to reflect
   societal stereotypes of their gender identity. For instance, a trans
   woman can be masculine, a tomboy, work as a mechanic, or hate wearing
   dresses - just as a cis woman can do any of those things.

   The rights of transgender or trans people - and whether they affect the
   rights of women - are often in the spotlight.

   This has led to legal disputes, protests and discussions about free
   speech.

   New government guidance aims to clarify how schools in England should
   treat transgender pupils.

What is trans and what does transgender mean?

   Gender identity is a term used by some to describe someone's sense of
   their gender.

   A transgender person's gender identity is not the same as the sex
   recorded on their original birth certificate.

   A transgender man is someone registered female at birth, but who
   identifies as a man.

   A transgender woman is someone registered male at birth, but who
   identifies as a woman.

   Trans is a shorter way of saying transgender.

   Gender dysphoria describes the "unease or dissatisfaction" some people
   feel about the difference between their biological sex and gender
   identity.

   Some people who do not consider themselves to have a solely male or
   female gender identity describe themselves as non-binary.

   A child's sex is recorded as male or female at birth, based on physical
   characteristics.

   Some people are born with chromosomal or other physical differences
   that can make this a complex judgement. They are sometimes referred to
   as intersex, or having differences of sexual development (DSD).

What is the DFE transgender guidance for schools?

   Under Department for Education (DFE) guidance issued in December 2023,
   teachers in England should tell parents if their child wants to change
   their gender identity at school.

   The Gender Questioning Guidance - which is not compulsory - says this
   should happen in the "vast majority of cases".

   In rare circumstances, teachers can decide to withhold information if
   revealing it could put a child at "significant risk" of harm.

   Schools should also "take a very cautious approach" if pupils want to
   use a new name, pronouns or uniform.

   Non-statutory guidance was issued to Northern Irish schools in 2019,
   and to Scottish schools in 2021. The Welsh government has not yet
   published guidance.

What medical support is available for children who want to change their
gender identity?

   Increasing numbers of children are being referred to the under-18s
   Gender Identity and Development Service (Gids) in England, especially
   those registered female at birth.

   NHS England says there were more than 5,000 referrals in 2021-2022,
   compared with 250 in 2011-12.

   Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust

   In some cases, young patients have been prescribed puberty blockers,
   which delay the onset of puberty. But the NHS says little is known
   about their long-term side effects.

   An independent review concluded that the current service is
   "unsustainable". It said that many children referred to Gids have
   complex needs, which can sometimes be overlooked after a gender
   dysphoria diagnosis.

   It called for a "fundamentally different" model of care for children.

   Following the review, the NHS decided puberty blockers should only be
   given to children and adolescents as part of clinical research.

   Gids will close in March 2024, and regional clinics will open, working
   alongside children's hospitals.

   Young people in Scotland can get a GP referral or refer themselves to
   the gender service at the Sandyford clinic.

   Those in Northern Ireland who want to talk to a specialist about their
   gender identity can use the Knowing Our Identity service.

   In Wales, children or teenagers can be referred or refer themselves to
   a specialist Gender Identity Clinic (GIC).

How many transgender people are there in the UK?

   In the 2021 census, 262,000 people aged 16 and over in England and
   Wales said their gender identity was different to their birth sex.

   Some academics raised concerns that the question may not have been
   understood, and that number could be an overestimate.

   The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it cannot be certain if
   that is the case, but the results were accurately processed and are
   broadly consistent with other estimates.

   A 2018 estimate by the government suggested there could be between
   200,000 and 500,000 people who identify as transgender across the UK as
   a whole.

What changes can transgender people make?

   Many transgender people live according to their chosen gender identity
   - including how they dress, and the name and pronouns they use.

   Some may take hormone medication, or have surgery.

   People can also apply to alter the gender listed on official documents.

   These social, physical and legal changes are known as transitioning.

   Under the Gender Recognition Act 2004, UK adults can get a gender
   recognition certificate (GRC) if they meet certain criteria:
     * having a gender dysphoria diagnosis
     * providing evidence of living full-time in their acquired gender for
       at least two years
     * making a declaration that they will live permanently in their
       acquired gender
     * are 18 or over
     * pay a £5 fee

   This means their acquired gender can be recorded on their birth,
   marriage and death certificates.

   You do not need a GRC to update your driving licence, passport or
   medical records.

   However, non-binary is not recognised as a gender on legal documents in
   the UK.

   About 7,000 certificates have been issued in England, Wales and
   Scotland.

What is happening to the rules about changing gender?

   In 2018, the UK government began considering changes to the law in
   England and Wales, which it said would make it easier for transgender
   people to alter their legal gender.

   It decided not to go ahead with some of the proposed changes, but did
   move the application process online and lowered the cost of a
   certificate.

   In 2022, Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) voted to remove the
   need for a medical diagnosis and lower the application age to 16.

   However, the UK government blocked this from becoming law because it
   said the draft law would conflict with equality protections applying
   across the whole of Great Britain.

   The Scottish government initially said it would challenge this decision
   in the courts, but subsequently confirmed it would abandon its appeal.

   Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville told the Scottish
   Parliament that the bill was "not in the bin, and awaits an incoming UK
   government that has more respect for devolution".

What do transgender rights mean for women-only spaces?

   There has been much debate about how to balance the rights of different
   groups within society.

   Much of this has focused on access to women-only spaces such as
   toilets, domestic abuse refuges and prisons.

   There has also been controversy about the participation of trans women
   in female-only categories in sports.

   Transgender people may wish to use services and facilities which align
   with their gender identity, whereas other groups say that these should
   be separated by birth sex.

   The Equality Act 2010 identifies a number of groups with protected
   characteristics - including gender reassignment and sex - and protects
   those groups from discrimination.

   But single-sex service providers can exclude transgender people where
   this is a ''proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim'', such
   as privacy or safety.

   However, some say the law is not clearly understood and women's
   sex-based rights are under threat.

   The Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that amending the
   Equality Act definition of "sex" to "biological sex" is worth further
   consideration.

   This would make it simpler for certain spaces to be single-sex,
   regardless of whether a person has a GRC.

   The UK government is considering the advice.

Transgender/ Non Binary / Gender Nonconforming Passengers

   TSA recognizes the concerns that some members of the transgender/non
   binary/gender nonconforming traveling public have with screening
   technology and certain security screening procedures at the nation's
   security checkpoints. TSA is committed to ensuring all travelers are
   treated with respect and dignity. Screening is conducted without regard
   to a person's race, color, sex, gender, gender identity, national
   origin, religion, or disability.

Prior to the Airport

TSA Precheck® Enhancements

   The TSA PreCheck program application has been updated to include an
   additional gender marker option to better serve non-binary and gender
   non-conforming Americans.  This action will ensure the TSA PreCheck
   system accurately reflects the traveler's gender. With this update, TSA
   allows TSA PreCheck applicants to select their gender based on
   self-attestation, regardless of the sex assigned at birth. If you are a
   member of the TSA PreCheck Application Program, you may call (855)
   347-8371 weekdays, between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. EDT, to request a gender
   data update.  You may also submit your inquiry online.

   This new gender marker option will not impact the security screening
   process. Security screening is conducted without discrimination against
   travelers based on their race, color, sex, gender, gender identity,
   national origin, religion or disability.

   Updating of a traveler's gender on other identification documents is
   not required to enroll in TSA PreCheck screening. Travelers will
   receive TSA PreCheck security screening even if their current gender
   differs from the gender provided when they enrolled in TSA PreCheck, as
   long as the name, known traveler number (KTN) and date of birth on
   their reservation matches their record with TSA. FAQs can be found at
   the TSA PreCheck Frequently Asked Questions.

Making Your Air Travel Reservations

   When making a reservation, please use the same name and date of birth
   indicated on your government-issued ID. We also encourage you to
   provide the gender indicated on your government-issued ID. TSA
   recommends that travelers contact air carrier customer service if the
   gender marker on their government-issued ID is not offered in the air
   carrier's reservation system. TSA continues to work closely with our
   domestic air-carrier partners to promote the use and acceptance of the
   "X" gender marker." Currently, two major domestic air carriers already
   offer "X" or undisclosed gender options in their travel-reservation
   systems, with a third air carrier offering the same in the fall of
   2022.  Read additional information about identification.

Contacting TSA in Advance

   Prior to a flight, you may contact the TSA Cares helpline at (855)
   787-2227 with questions about screening policies and procedures, as
   well as what to expect as you proceed through the security checkpoint.
   You may request the assistance of a Passenger Support Specialist, who
   will provide assistance through the security screening process.

While at the Airport

Travel Document Checker

   At the checkpoint, present your government-issued identification and
   boarding pass to the TSA officer who will ensure the identification and
   boarding pass are authentic and that the name shown on each document is
   exactly the same. If the name shown on the identification document does
   not exactly match the name on the boarding pass, you may need to go to
   your airline ticket counter for a new boarding pass.

   TSA has updated its checkpoint procedures to remove gender
   considerations when validating a traveler's identification at airport
   security checkpoints. When travelers appear at the travel-document
   checker podium for identity verification, gender information is not
   considered. Go to Security Screening Identification for more
   information.

Inform the TSA Officer

   All baggage - both checked baggage and carry-on baggage - must go
   through the screening process. For carry-on baggage - inform the TSA
   officer if you have medically necessary liquids and/or medications,
   medical equipment, and/or prostheses, and separate them from other
   belongings before screening begins. If a bag must be opened by an
   officer to resolve an alarm, you may ask that the bag be opened and
   inspected in private.

Physical Screening Procedures

   Passenger screening at the airport is part of TSA's layered approach to
   security to get you safely to your destination. Read about
   various screening measures in place to secure aviation.

   You will be screened by Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), a
   walk-through metal detector (WTMD), and/or a pat-down procedure.

   The AIT Screening Process:

   Currently, TSA's AIT units utilize software that relies on
   gender-specific algorithms and a generic physical outline of the human
   body that is identical for all passengers. When you enter the imaging
   portal, the TSA officer will press a button designating your gender as
   male or female based on the TSA officer's assessment of how you
   present. The equipment then conducts a scan and indicates areas on the
   body warranting further screening, if necessary.

   If there is an alarm, a TSA officer may show you, on a screen, where
   the alarm is present. Additional screening, including a pat-down
   procedure, may be conducted to determine whether a prohibited item is
   present.

   AIT Technology Enhancements and Updated Screening Procedures:

   TSA identified an opportunity to enhance our existing AIT security
   effectiveness capabilities and simultaneously implement a
   gender-neutral algorithm.  In coordination with the system
   manufacturer, TSA is in the process of testing this new algorithm. This
   change will benefit all travelers, including transgender, nonbinary,
   and other gender-nonconforming travelers who previously have been
   required to undergo additional screening due to alarms in sensitive
   areas.  Upon completion of successful testing, TSA anticipates
   initiating deployment of the technology enhancement to airports later
   this year.

   Beginning in May 2022, TSA is also updating its screening procedures to
   better serve transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming travelers
   through less invasive screening procedures for passengers who trigger
   the AIT scanner in a sensitive area. This change will reduce the number
   of pat downs for TSOs and the travelling public without compromising
   security, and will be in effect until the gender-neutral AIT screening
   technology is deployed.

   You may ask for a supervisor at any point during the AIT screening
   process.

   Pat-Downs: If there is a screening alarm by technology (i.e., AIT,
   WTMD), or if you opt-out of screening by technology, a pat-down
   procedure is performed, and is generally conducted by an officer that
   is the same gender as the TSA officer's assessment of how you present.
   Alternatively, you may choose to inform the officer of your gender
   identity and make a request that the pat-down be conducted by an
   officer of that gender.

   Screening can be conducted in the checkpoint area, or you may request
   to have a pat-down in private and be accompanied by a companion of your
   choice. You may bring your carry-on baggage to the private screening
   area and may request a chair to sit if needed. You will not be asked to
   remove or lift any article of clothing to reveal sensitive body areas.
   You may be asked to adjust loose fitting clothing by the TSA officer
   doing the pat-down procedure. For additional information about the
   pat-down, see Security Screening. Please also see additional guidance
   for on body prostheses.

Contact Us

   If you have experienced an inappropriate screening process at a
   security checkpoint, you may request to speak with a supervisor at the
   checkpoint. You may also submit your concern to the TSA Contact Center.

   If you have experienced discrimination, you may email or submit a civil
   rights complaint.

The Bottom Line

   The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community has seen
   both significant progress and painful setbacks recently. The 2015
   Supreme Court ruling in favor of the freedom to marry was a major step
   toward legal equality, and there have been many successes since then at
   the federal, state, and local levels, including increased protections
   for transgender and gender non-conforming people. However, since the
   ruling, there have also been more than 200 anti-LGBT bills introduced
   in 20 states--and a recently leaked executive order draft suggests that
   the current administration intends to undermine established
   non-discrimination protections and open the door to a wide range of
   harms to the LGBT population.

   To help make sense of the current policy landscape in the states for
   LGBT people, and transgender people specifically, Mapping Transgender
   Equality in the United States looks at legal equality for transgender
   people across the country. The gender identity tally is comprised of 25
   state laws and policies in the five key categories of
   Non-Discrimination, LGBT Youth Laws and Policies, Health and Safety,
   Ability for Transgender People to Correct the Name and Gender Marker on
   Identity Documents, and Adoption and Parenting.

Sexual Orientation Policy Tally

   The term "sexual orientation" is loosely defined as a person's pattern
   of romantic or sexual attraction to people of the opposite sex or
   gender, the same sex or gender, or more than one sex or gender. Laws
   that explicitly mention sexual orientation primarily protect or harm
   lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. That said, transgender people who
   are lesbian, gay or bisexual can be affected by laws that explicitly
   mention sexual orientation.

Gender Identity Policy Tally

   "Gender identity" is a person's deeply-felt inner sense of being male,
   female, or something else or in-between. "Gender expression" refers to
   a person's characteristics and behaviors such as appearance, dress,
   mannerisms and speech patterns that can be described as masculine,
   feminine, or something else. Gender identity and expression are
   independent of sexual orientation, and transgender people may identify
   as heterosexual, lesbian, gay or bisexual. Laws that explicitly mention
   "gender identity" or "gender identity and expression" primarily protect
   or harm transgender people. These laws also can apply to people who are
   not transgender, but whose sense of gender or manner of dress does not
   adhere to gender stereotypes.

Your Guide to the Term `Transgender' and Its Use

   Medically reviewed by Francis Kuehnle, MSN, RN-BC -- By Soren Hodshire

     * Definition

     * Takeaway

   "Transgender" is one of many adjectives that can apply to a person. It
   simply means their current gender is not the same as the one they were
   assigned at birth.

   We're all expected to grow and change as we get older. We grow taller
   and wiser, and we come to a deeper understanding of ourselves.

   For some of us, this deeper understanding comes with the knowledge that
   we've been raised as the wrong gender.

   When a person's true gender is different from the one they were
   assigned at birth, we describe this as being transgender.

   In this article, we explore what being transgender means and what
   gender diversity exists under the trans umbrella.

   What does `transgender' mean?

   The term "transgender" (trans for short) is one of many adjectives that
   can be applied to a person. Being trans means you do not identify with
   the gender you were assigned at birth. It does not indicate what your
   gender is.

   The opposite of transgender is cisgender, which indicates that you do
   identify with the gender you were assigned at birth. Both prefixes
   "cis" and "trans" have Latin meanings:
     * trans means "across from" or "the other side of"
     * cis means "on the same side" or "the same as"

   "Transgender" is an umbrella term for many different gender identities
   and expressions. Some people may medically, socially, and legally
   transition, but doing these things is not a requirement to be
   transgender.

   Although the word we use today may not have been used in the past, the
   idea of being trans or gender nonconforming has always existed in
   Indigenous, Western, and Eastern cultures. The meanings and attributes
   of gender, gender expression, and gender roles vary from culture to
   culture, past and present.

Who falls under the transgender umbrella?

   "Transgender" is an umbrella term, meaning that many different gender
   identities and expressions are included in this community.

   For example:
     * nonbinary
     * genderfluid
     * genderqueer
     * agender
     * trans man
     * trans woman

   It's possible to also transition to many other genders that aren't
   exclusively man or woman, or to a mix of genders at different times,
   and you're still part of the community.

When was the term `transgender' coined?

   The first recorded use of the word "transgender" was in the book
   "Sexual Hygiene and Pathology" by John F. Oliven, MD, in 1965.

   How to use the term `transgender'

   "Transgender" is an adjective. It's not a noun. You use it similarly to
   other adjectives like short, tall, young, or old.

   If you were describing a woman who was short, you wouldn't call her "a
   short"; you would likely say "a short woman." Likewise, when talking
   about someone in the transgender community, you don't call a trans
   person "a trans," "a transgender," or "a they."

   When talking about a group, some correct terms to use are "transgender
   people" or "the transgender community."

The difference between trans man and trans woman

   A trans man is a man who is transgender. They were assigned a feminine
   sex and gender at birth and have since transitioned to a masculine
   gender. Some people still use "FTM (female-to-male)" when describing
   themselves as trans men, but this term is often considered outdated and
   should not be applied to people without their consent.

   A trans woman is a woman who is trans. They were assigned a masculine
   sex and gender at birth and have since transitioned to a feminine
   gender. They similarly might use the term "MTF (male-to-female)," but
   the same concerns about consent apply to this more outdated initialism.

   It's important to remember that these terms are meant to express the
   gender of the person and not the genitalia you believe they have.

   To better understand the spectrum of sex and gender (including intersex
   people), you can check out this article.

Transgender or transsexual

   Most people use "transgender" in place of "transsexual."

   "Transsexual" is considered an outdated term according to the American
   Psychological Association style guide, although some people may use it
   as an identity term for themselves. It should not be used for someone
   without their consent.

   You can learn more about the difference between "transgender" and
   "transsexual" here.

   Gender nonconforming vs. transgender

   Being gender nonconforming means you're not conforming to the typical
   gendered standards of your culture (be it your gender expression,
   gender roles, etc.) at the time.

   Being transgender is when your gender doesn't align with the one you
   were assigned at birth. Sometimes being gender nonconforming coincides
   with being transgender, but not always. Many gender nonconforming
   people are cisgender and heterosexual.

   This idea might seem new, but you've likely seen examples of it your
   entire life:
     * Someone who is a cis man, straight, and chooses to stay home to
       take care of their children would be considered gender
       nonconforming but is not transgender.
     * A cisgender woman who chooses to cut their hair short and wear a
       tuxedo at fancy events would be considered gender nonconforming but
       is not transgender.
     * A trans man who chooses to wear nail polish or makeup is both
       gender nonconforming and transgender.

   A person's gender expression and the labels they use can often differ
   from your expectations. Sometimes you might see someone you think is
   more feminine or masculine based on your interpretations of gender, but
   they might consider themselves something else because of their own
   views.

What about pronouns?

   While many men (including trans men) use he/him pronouns, many women
   (trans women included) use she/her pronouns, and many non-binary people
   use they/them pronouns - that's not the case for everyone.

   Takeaway

   Being transgender means you experience an incongruence with the gender
   you were assigned at birth.

   "Trans" is also an umbrella term that includes nonbinary, agender,
   genderqueer, and many other identities not listed here.

   Regardless of whether you fully understand someone's gender, it's
   important to respect the terms someone uses to express it.

Filling gaps in gender diversity data in Canada

   Prior to the 2021 Census, some individuals indicated that they were not
   able to see themselves in the two responses of male or female on the
   existing sex question in the census.

   Following extensive consultation and countrywide engagement with the
   Canadian population, the census evolved--as it has for more than a
   century--to reflect societal changes, adding new content on gender
   in 2021.

   Beginning in 2021, the precision of "at birth" was added to the sex
   question on the census questionnaire, and a new question on gender was
   included. As a result, the historical continuity of information on sex
   was maintained while allowing all cisgender, transgender and non-binary
   individuals to report their gender. This addressed an important
   information gap on gender diversity (see Filling the gaps: Information
   on gender in the 2021 Census and 2021 Census: Sex at birth and
   gender--the whole picture).

   For many people, their gender corresponds to their sex at birth
   (cisgender men and cisgender women). For some, these do not align
   (transgender men and transgender women) or their gender is not
   exclusively "man" or "woman" (non-binary people).

   The strength of the census is to provide reliable data for local
   communities throughout the country and for smaller populations such as
   the transgender and non-binary populations. Statistics Canada always
   protects privacy and confidentiality of respondents when disseminating
   detailed data.

   These modifications reflect today's reality in terms of the evolving
   acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual diversity and an
   emerging social and legislative recognition of transgender, non-binary
   and LGBTQ2+ people in general, that is, people who are lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, or who use other terms
   related to gender or sexual diversity. In 2017, the Canadian government
   amended the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Criminal Code to
   protect individuals from discrimination and hate crimes based on gender
   identity and expression.

   These data can be used by public decision makers, employers, and
   providers of health care, education, justice, and other services to
   better meet the needs of all men and women--including transgender men
   and women--and non-binary people in their communities.

Highlights

   The 2021 Census of Population included for the first time a question on
   gender and the precision of "at birth" on the sex question, allowing
   all cisgender, transgender and non-binary individuals to report their
   gender.

   Canada is the first country to collect and publish data on gender
   diversity from a national census.

   Of the nearly 30.5 million people in Canada aged 15 and older living in
   a private household in May 2021, 100,815 were transgender (59,460) or
   non-binary (41,355), accounting for 0.33% of the population in this age
   group.

   The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were three to
   seven times higher for Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2006, 0.79%)
   and millennials (born between 1981 and 1996, 0.51%) than for Generation
   X (born between 1966 and 1980, 0.19%), baby boomers (born
   between 1946 and 1965, 0.15%) and the Interwar and Greatest Generations
   (born in 1945 or earlier, 0.12%).

   Over time, the acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual
   diversity has evolved. Further, there has been social and legislative
   recognition of transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people in general.
   Younger generations may be more comfortable reporting their gender
   identity than older generations.

   In May 2021, the Canadian population aged 15 and older had an average
   age of 48.0 years. In comparison, the transgender population had an
   average age of 39.4 years, while the non-binary population had an
   average age of 30.4 years.

   Just under 1 in 100 young adults aged 20 to 24 were non-binary or
   transgender (0.85%).

   Nova Scotia (0.48%), Yukon (0.47%) and British Columbia (0.44%) had the
   highest proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 and
   older among provinces and territories.

   Victoria (0.75%), Halifax (0.66%) and Fredericton (0.60%) had the most
   gender diversity among Canadian large urban centres.

   Just over half of non-binary people aged 15 and older (52.7%) lived in
   one of Canada's six largest urban centres: Toronto (15.3%), Montréal
   (11.0%), Vancouver (10.8%), Ottawa-Gatineau (5.6%), Edmonton (5.4%) and
   Calgary (4.5%).

   Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary people aged 15 and older (15.5%) lived in the
   downtown core of a large urban centre. This share was more than twice
   that of transgender people (7.0%) and over three times higher than that
   of cisgender people (4.7%).

One in 300 people in Canada aged 15 and older are transgender or non-binary

   Thumbnail for Infographic 1: One in 300 people in Canada aged 15 and

   In May 2021, there were 59,460 people in Canada aged 15 and older
   living in a private household who were transgender (0.19%)
   and 41,355 who were non-binary (0.14%). Together, they
   represented 1 in 300 people, or 0.33% of the population aged 15 and
   older.

Counting transgender people in the 2021 Census and data comparability

   Canada is the first country to collect and publish data on gender
   diversity from a national census. While Canada's census data and
   surveys from other countries are not strictly comparable, they provide
   valuable insight into gender diversity globally.

   In Canada, 0.2% of the population aged 18 and older was transgender
   in 2021. Belgium (0.5% among people aged 18 to 75 in 2021) and New
   Zealand (0.5% among people aged 18 and older in 2020) have also
   published representative survey-based data on their transgender
   populations.

   Other countries have published 2021 data on transgender people using
   crowdsourcing and non-representative surveys, including Ireland (0.6%
   among people aged 18 and older), England and Wales (0.6% among people
   aged 16 and older), and the United States (0.8% among people
   aged 18 and older).

   Among the 59,460 transgender people, there were more transgender women
   (31,555) than transgender men (27,905).

The transgender and non-binary generation gap

   Over time, the acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual
   diversity has evolved. Further, there has been social and legislative
   recognition of transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people in general.
   Younger generations may be more comfortable reporting their gender
   identity than older generations.

   The Canadian population aged 15 and older can be divided into six
   generations, each born in a different period. The following generations
   (and their age groups in May 2021) are based on work from the Pew
   Research Center and existing literature, and are consistent with the
   Census in Brief: A generational portrait of Canada's aging population
   from the 2021 Census:

   Greatest Generation: people aged 94 or older (born before 1928)

   Interwar Generation: people aged 76 to 93 (born between 1928 and 1945)

   Baby boomers: people aged 56 to 75 (born between 1946 and 1965)

   Generation X: people aged 41 to 55 (born between 1966 and 1980)

   Generation Y (millennials): people aged 25 to 40 (born
   between 1981 and 1996)

   Generation Z: people aged 15 to 24 (born between 1997 and 2006)

   Younger generations had larger shares of those who were transgender or
   non-binary. The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were
   three to seven times higher for Generation Z (0.79%) and millennials
   (0.51%) than for Generation X (0.19%), baby boomers (0.15%) and the
   Interwar and Greatest Generations (0.12%).

   Each generation holds attitudes and demonstrates behaviours informed by
   the historical context in which its members were raised. Generation Z
   was born in the Internet age, and millennials came of age during a time
   when the Internet was changing the way we gather and process
   information. The Internet, along with social media and web-connected
   personal devices, may have contributed to the increasing awareness of
   gender diversity--especially among younger generations--by providing
   transgender and non-binary individuals with virtual support communities
   and answers to questions that were less accessible to older
   generations.

Non-binary and transgender people are younger on average than cisgender people

   Chart 2: Gender diversity is highest among 20- to 24-year-olds

   In May 2021, the Canadian population aged 15 and older had an average
   age of 48.0 years. In comparison, the transgender population had an
   average age of 39.4 years, while the non-binary population had an
   average age of 30.4 years.

   Transgender men (34.9 years) were almost a decade younger on average
   than transgender women (43.3 years).

   Close to two-thirds (62.0%) of the 100,815 individuals who were
   transgender or non-binary were younger than 35.

   Gender diversity was highest among those aged 20 to 24,
   almost 1 in 100 (0.85%) of whom were transgender or non-binary. In
   comparison, 1 in 700 were transgender or non-binary among people
   aged 65 and older.

Diversity within gender diversity: Most common terms to describe non-binary
gender

   In this release, the term "non-binary" is used to describe all genders
   that are neither exclusively man nor woman, although individuals might
   self-identify with other terms.

   Gender is experienced in different ways. The 2021 Census asked people
   to describe their gender via a write-in response so that they could
   indicate what term was most relevant to them. Terminology related to
   gender diversity continues to evolve, and the ways to report gender
   will also continue to evolve. Statistics Canada thanks the Canadian
   population for contributing to this ongoing discussion.

   Over two-thirds (70.5%) of people aged 15 and older who provided
   answers to the write-in option used the term "non-binary" when
   specifying their gender.

   Together, over 1 in 6 non-binary people described their gender as
   "fluid" (7.3%), "agender" (5.1%) or "queer" (4.1%).

   Other responses included "gender neutral" (2.9%), "Two-Spirit" (2.2%),
   "neither man nor woman" (1.3%) and "gender-nonconforming" (1.1%).

   The term "Two-Spirit," which is specific to some Indigenous peoples of
   North America, was provided in greater proportion by non-binary people
   living in Western Canada, especially in Manitoba (4.8%) where a large
   Indigenous population (First Nations people, Métis and Inuit) resides.

Among provinces and territories, Nova Scotia, Yukon and British Columbia show
the highest proportions of transgender and non-binary individuals

   Although transgender and non-binary people lived in every province and
   territory in Canada, they were concentrated in certain areas.
   Almost 2 in 5 transgender or non-binary people (39.1%) called Ontario
   home in 2021 (39,450), and this corresponds to Ontario's share of
   Canada's population aged 15 and older (38.8%).

Map 1  Thumbnail for map 1: Canada's most populous province, Ontario, is home

   Gender diversity varies by region. Provincially, almost 1 in 200 people
   living in Nova Scotia (0.48%) and British Columbia (0.44%) were
   transgender or non-binary, proportions above the national average
   of 0.33%. Although counts were lower, Yukon (0.47%) also had one of the
   highest proportions in Canada.

   Among the provinces, Quebec had the smallest proportions of transgender
   (0.14%) and non-binary (0.09%) people, followed by Saskatchewan (0.16%
   and 0.12%, respectively).

About 1 in 100 people aged 15 to 34 in Nova Scotia and British Columbia are
transgender or non-binary

   Gender diversity was more common among people aged 15 to 34 than those
   aged 35 and older. Approximately 1 in 150 people aged 15 to 34 in
   Canada were transgender or non-binary (0.69%), compared
   with 1 in 550 people aged 35 and older (0.18%).

   Nova Scotia (1.17%) and British Columbia (0.90%) had the largest
   proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 to 34 among
   provinces, while Quebec (0.52%) and Saskatchewan (0.59%) had the lowest
   proportions.

   Among people aged 15 to 34, about 1 in 500 (0.20%) in Canada were
   transgender men and 1 in 650 (0.15%) were transgender women. The
   largest proportions of transgender men aged 15 to 34 were found in Nova
   Scotia (0.33%), New Brunswick (0.26%), and Newfoundland and Labrador
   (0.26%), while Nova Scotia (0.21%), Newfoundland and Labrador (0.19%),
   and British Columbia (0.19%) had the largest proportions of transgender
   women.

   Moreover, approximately 1 in 300 (0.34%) people aged 15 to 34 in Canada
   were non-binary. The largest proportion of non-binary people
   aged 15 to 34 was in Nova Scotia, at 0.63%, followed by British
   Columbia (0.49%) and New Brunswick (0.39%). Quebec had the lowest
   proportion in this age group, at 0.25%.

The vast majority of non-binary individuals in Canada live in an urban setting

   Urban living was more popular among non-binary individuals than among
   transgender and cisgender individuals. In 2021, over 9 in 10 non-binary
   people aged 15 and older in Canada (92.5%) lived in an urban centre of
   over 100,000 people, also called a census metropolitan area (CMA), or a
   mid-sized urban centre of over 10,000 people called a census
   agglomeration. This proportion was higher than for the Canadian
   population as a whole (84.1%).

Chart 5  Chart 5: Higher proportion of non-binary people in Canada living in

Higher proportion of non-binary people in Canada living in urban areas than

   Chart 5: Higher proportion of non-binary people in Canada living in
   urban areas than transgender and cisgender people

   Among all CMAs, the largest proportions of transgender and non-binary
   people aged 15 and older were found in Victoria (0.75%), Halifax
   (0.66%) and Fredericton (0.60%), on the west and the east coasts of
   Canada.

   A number of factors could explain the greater gender diversity in these
   urban centres. Victoria, Halifax and Fredericton experienced stronger
   population growth from 2016 to 2021 than the national average.
   Moreover, in 2021, Halifax (27.6%) and Fredericton (26.0%) had larger
   proportions of people aged 15 to 34 than the national average (25.0%).
   All three urban centres are home to several major colleges and
   universities, and, since students tend to be younger, this could
   explain the proportionally higher presence of transgender and
   non-binary people in these urban centres.

   The three large urban centres with the lowest levels of gender
   diversity were all found in Quebec: Drummondville (0.17%), Saguenay
   (0.17%) and Trois-Rivières (0.20%). The populations of these urban
   centres are generally older (Census in Brief: A portrait of Canada's
   growing population aged 85 and older from the 2021 Census) than those
   of other Canadian CMAs. Drummondville (22.4%), Saguenay (21.4%) and
   Trois-Rivières (22.5%) had smaller proportions of people
   aged 15 to 34 than the national average (25.0%).

Over half of non-binary people live in Canada's six largest urban centres

   For the majority of non-binary people in Canada aged 15 and older
   (52.7%), urban living meant residing in one of Canada's six largest
   urban centres: Toronto (15.3%), Montréal (11.0%), Vancouver (10.8%),
   Ottawa-Gatineau (5.6%), Edmonton (5.4%) and Calgary (4.5%).

   Just under half of transgender women (49.1%) and transgender men
   (47.0%) aged 15 and older lived in 1 of these 6 largest urban centres,
   proportions similar to those of cisgender women (47.9%) and cisgender
   men (47.3%) living in these CMAs.

   While Quebec had the lowest proportion of transgender and non-binary
   people among the provinces, almost three-quarters (71.5%) of the
   non-binary people and over half (54.7%) of the transgender people in
   Quebec lived in the CMA of Montréal. By way of comparison, half of all
   Quebec residents aged 15 and older lived in the Montréal CMA.

   The proportion of non-binary people in Quebec living in the Montréal
   CMA (71.5%) was higher than the comparable proportions observed in the
   large urban areas of Vancouver (home to 53.1% of non-binary people in
   British Columbia) and Toronto (home to 41.3% of non-binary people in
   Ontario).

Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary people live downtown

   Living in a downtown core was also more popular for non-binary people
   than for transgender and cisgender people. Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary
   people aged 15 and older in Canada (15.5%) were living in the downtown
   of one of the country's 41 CMAs, and 7.3% lived in the downtown of 1 of
   the 6 largest CMAs. The proportion of non-binary individuals living in
   one of the CMA downtowns was over twice that of transgender (7.0%) and
   cisgender (4.7%) individuals.

   In Canada, approximately 1 in 200 people aged 15 and older living in a
   CMA downtown were non-binary (0.45%). Comparatively, 1 in 350 people
   were transgender men (0.13%) or transgender women (0.16%).

   Fredericton (1.8%), Nanaimo (1.5%) and Halifax (1.5%) had the largest
   proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 and older
   living downtown.

   Several factors could explain the larger share of non-binary people
   living in downtown cores. First, over one-third of individuals living
   in a CMA downtown were aged 15 to 34 (37.4%), and gender diversity was
   more common among people in this age group than among older people.
   Second, the concentration of numerous postsecondary educational
   institutions within downtown cores, combined with a more cosmopolitan
   atmosphere and the greater availability of social spaces and
   specialized services for transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people
   more broadly, may also explain the higher presence of non-binary people
   in the heart of large urban centres.

Transgender or non-binary populations have reported poorer mental health
outcomes

   Starting in 2018, Statistics Canada began introducing the new question
   on gender and the modified question on sex at birth on most health and
   social surveys.

   The 2018 Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces was the first
   large-scale household survey conducted by Statistics Canada to collect
   information about sex at birth and gender of respondents. It found
   that 1 in 400 people in Canada aged 15 and older were transgender or
   non-binary (0.24%).

   The survey also revealed important differences in victimization,
   discrimination and mental health by the gender diversity status of
   respondents. For example, almost two-thirds of transgender and
   non-binary individuals (65%) reported poor or fair mental health, five
   times the proportion of those who were cisgender (11%). Transgender and
   non-binary people were also more likely to have seriously contemplated
   suicide in their lifetimes than those who were cisgender (45%
   versus 16%).

   The 2019 Survey of Postsecondary Faculty and Researchers, conducted
   among university and college faculty, postdoctoral fellows and PhD
   students, found that 1.2% of postdoctoral fellows were non-binary, as
   were 0.7% of PhD students. Approximately 0.2% of university and college
   faculty were non-binary.

   Among postsecondary faculty and researchers in 2019, just
   over 1 in 10 men (11%) experienced unfair treatment or discrimination,
   compared with 20% of women and 41% of non-binary people.

   A socioeconomic analysis of the LGBTQ2+ population suggests transgender
   and non-binary populations may not have had the resources to cope with
   unexpected financial stress. According to the 2018 Canadian Housing
   Survey, non-binary individuals were more likely to live in a dwelling
   requiring major repairs (29%) than men or women (7%).

   In 2019, Trans PULSE Canada conducted a national community-based survey
   on the health and well-being of close to 3,000 transgender and
   non-binary people aged 14 and older, of whom around 800 respondents
   participated in a COVID-19 survey the following year. Results show that
   transgender and non-binary participants, who experienced greater levels
   of economic insecurity and social marginalization before the pandemic,
   may have been particularly affected. They found that a majority of
   transgender and non-binary people experienced both negative financial
   and social impacts from the pandemic.

   Using crowdsourced data collection, Statistics Canada found important
   gender differences in the self-perceived mental health of individuals
   in Canada during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. About
   two-thirds (68%) of non-binary participants reported fair or poor
   mental health, compared with just over one-quarter (26%) of women and
   just over one-fifth (21%) of men who participated in the crowdsource
   initiative.

Looking ahead

   The 2021 Census release on families, households and marital status,
   which will take place on July 13, 2022, will include analysis and data
   tables on couples. In particular, there will be analysis of same-gender
   and different-gender couples, as well as couples composed of at least
   one transgender person or at least one non-binary person.

   Family and household characteristics and sociocultural and
   socioeconomic data from the 2021 Census released over the next months
   will continue to enrich the portrait of the transgender and non-binary
   populations in Canada.

Definitions, concepts and geography

   In April 2018, Statistics Canada published new metadata standards for
   sex at birth and gender to better reflect the way the Canadian
   population self-identifies. Throughout the winter of 2021, Statistics
   Canada held a public consultation on the update to the gender standard
   to ensure it remains relevant and meaningful for the communities of
   interest.

   The standards on sex at birth and gender were modified to reflect
   feedback received during this consultation. The updated standards were
   published in October 2021, and a "What we heard" report summarizing
   comments received during the public consultation will be published in
   the coming months.

   The sex at birth standard provides a classification variant with three
   categories (male, female and intersex). However, for reasons related to
   the small size of the intersex population and the challenges in
   identifying intersex people, Statistics Canada does not currently
   collect specific information on intersex people in Canada.

   Tables 1 and 2 present distributions of the Canadian population
   aged 15 and older living in a private household by sex according to
   data from the 1991 to 2016 censuses and sex at birth and gender
   using 2021 Census data.

   In 2021, the number of people whose sex was male was very similar to
   the number of men. The same was observed among people whose sex was
   female compared with women. These similarities can be explained by the
   relatively small size of the transgender and non-binary populations.
   Moreover, the distribution of the population aged 15 and older in
   private households by sex (from 1991 to 2016) and sex at birth
   (in 2021) was very similar between census years.

   In this article, certain gender non-binary terms were grouped based on
   their similarities (e.g., "genderqueer," "queer man" and "queer woman"
   are all included in the estimate of "queer"). For more information on
   collection and processing methods of responses to the "specify" option
   for the gender question, please refer to the Age, Sex at Birth and
   Gender Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021.

   The term "Two-Spirit" is specific to some Indigenous peoples of North
   America (see gender classification). However, the Indigenous identity
   of individuals was not taken into account when coding answers to the
   "specify" option for the gender question. The number of "Two-Spirit"
   answers may be smaller if only Indigenous individuals were included.

   The definitions for terms describing non-binary gender are included in
   the Gender and Sexual Diversity Glossary, published by the Translation
   Bureau.

   In this release, the analysis of gender diversity results is limited to
   the population aged 15 and older even though the question was asked
   regardless of age, as children aged 14 and younger may not be fully
   aware of their gender identity or may not have defined it yet.

   In the Census in brief: A generational portrait of Canada's aging
   population from the 2021 Census, Generation Z is defined as people born
   between 1997 and 2012 and aged 9 to 24 in May 2021. In this article,
   since the analysis is focused on the population aged 15 and older,
   Generation Z is redefined as those born between 1997 and 2006 and
   aged 15 to 24 in May 2021.

   To ensure the confidentiality of responses collected for
   the 2021 Census, a random rounding process is used to alter the values
   of released data. As a result, when these data are summed or grouped,
   the total value may not match the sum of the individual values, since
   the total and subtotals are independently rounded. Similarly,
   percentage distributions, which are calculated on rounded data, may not
   necessarily add up to 100%.

Modules

Who Are Transgender People?

   Trans people experience significant health disparities. To reduce
   disparities, it is vital that we all learn
   more about transgender people and how to improve services for trans
   communities.

Words That Matter, Part 1

   Exploring core concepts related to gender, sex, and sexual orientation
   can help us understand different identities.

What's in a Pronoun?

   To be respectful it's important to ask everyone what pronoun they use,
   and then use those pronouns consistently.

Words That Matter, Part 2

   We've presented a number of trans related terms. Let's put them into
   context.

Facing Down Stigma

   Transgender people face stigma daily. Learn about the impact of
   transphobia on health outcomes.

Words That Matter, Part 3

   Let's apply some of these concepts in real world scenarios.

How To Be an Ally

   Review core concepts and learn some initial steps to becoming an ally
   to trans communities.

   mentale. En tant qu'individus, citoyens, amis, ou familles de personnes
   LGBT, nous avons tous un rôle à jouer dans la lutte contre ces
   discriminations et ces violences. Face à l'intolérance, à nous de faire

Accepter et accueillir les personnes LGBT.

   Au travail, à l'école, dans notre cercle familiale ou amical, nous
   avons tous les moyens de participer à la création d'un environnement
   inclusif et bienveillant pour les personnes LGBT. Accepter l'autre
   comme il est, quelles que soient son orientation sexuelles ou son
   identité de genre, lui tendre la main : peu importe le contexte, nous
   pouvons tous agir pour faire cesser les discriminations et les
   violences homophobes et transphobes.
   Dans le cercle familial et amical

   Si l'un de vos proches se confie à vous sur son (BUTTON) homosexualité
   ou sa transidentité, et sur les difficultés qu'il rencontre au
   quotidien, il faut :
     * le soutenir et lui dire son soutien ;
     * être à l'écoute de ses besoins ;
     * veiller à ce qu'il soit respecté ;
     * l'orienter, voire l'accompagner s'il en exprime le besoin, vers des
       associations.

   Que nous ayons ou non un proche LGBT dans notre cercle familial ou
   amical, il est nécessaire de s'interposer lorsqu'on est témoin d'un
   propos ou d'une violence LGBTphobe au sein de notre entourage. Ce qui
   peut sembler être une « blague de mauvais goût » ou une « simple
   insulte » n'est jamais sans conséquences. Il faut montrer l'exemple et
   sortir du silence afin de sensibiliser ses proches et faire cesser
   cette stigmatisation.
   Au travail

   Si l'un de vos collègues^4 soupçonne ou fait face à une (BUTTON)
   discrimination en raison de son (BUTTON) orientation sexuelle ou de son
   identité de genre, il faut :
     * le soutenir et lui dire ;
     * être à l'écoute de sa situation et de ses besoins ;
     * veiller à ce qu'il soit intégré et respecté dans l'entreprise ;
     * en informer les ressources humaines, les représentants du
       personnel ou les délégués syndicaux, voire la direction, et
       s'assurer que les auteurs soient identifiés et sanctionnés en
       conséquence.

   Que nous ayons un collègue LGBT ou non dans notre entreprise,
   s'interposer lorsqu'on est témoin d'un propos ou d'une violence
   LGBTphobe est une manière de faire la différence. Ce qui peut sembler
   être une « blague de mauvais goût » ou une « simple insulte » (même si
   elle ne semble pas viser directement une personne LGBT) est en réalité
   un comportement qui alimente une forme de complaisance face à la
   discrimination. Alors, le mieux est de montrer l'exemple : sortir du
   silence pour sensibiliser ses collègues et faire cesser ces violences,
   qui sont tout sauf anodines.
   41%

   des employés entendent des expressions LGBTphobes au sein de leur
   organisation, de leur entreprise.
   À l'école

   Il n'est pas toujours facile de s'affirmer à l'école, au collège ou au
   lycée, ni même dans ses études supérieures. Néanmoins, montrer son
   appui à un camarade victime de violences ou de discriminations est un
   acte nécessaire, légitime et courageux.
   Il existe également d'autres manières de s'investir dans le soutien des
   LGBT, en menant des actions de sensibilisation, par exemple :
     * faire intervenir des associations en classe ;
     * organiser des journées d'information et de discussion.

   Il est important d'oser proposer de telles initiatives à la direction
   de son établissement. Elle saura être à l'écoute ! Si vous êtes
   professeur et témoin ou victime de violence ou de discrimination
   LGBTphobe, parlez-en à vos collègues et à votre hiérarchie. Ensemble,
   vous pourrez mettre en place des actions de sensibilisation pour les
   élèves et ainsi agir pour faire cesser les discriminations au sein de
   votre établissement.
   Des services d'aide et d'écoute existent pour les élèves et le corps
   enseignant. L'Éducation nationale met également des guides et des kits
   de sensibilisation à disposition des établissements scolaires. Toutes
   ces ressources sont disponibles sur une page spéciale, dédiée à la
   lutte contre l'homophobie et la transphobie à l'école.
   Au club sportif

   Quand on pratique un sport, on sait qu'il est important de se soutenir
   les uns les autres et de se faire confiance. La haine contre les
   LGBT n'a pas sa place dans le milieu du sport. Le ministère chargé des
   Sports propose des ressources pour agir et mettre en place des actions
   de sensibilisation dans les clubs sportifs :

What Is Transgender?

   Transgender - or trans* for short - is an umbrella term for those whose
   gender differs from that which they were assigned at birth. This
   includes binary trans people (trans men and trans women) and non-binary
   trans people, who may use descriptors like gender-queer, bi-gender,
   a-gender, or gender-fluid (though not all non-binary people use trans
   as a descriptor - refer to our gender diversity pages for more
   information).

   Trans people may express their gender in a variety of ways and that may
   vary in certain contexts and at certain times. Therefore it is
   important to remember that there is no one way to `be' trans as it can
   mean many different things to different people. Transition for some
   people may mean changing their name and choosing a pronoun that feels
   more appropriate - a process that is often referred to as `social
   transition'. For others, transition may involve gender affirming
   medical treatments, such as hormones and surgical interventions -
   processes referred to as `medical transition'.

   Many trans people experience a feeling of distress which is clinically
   termed `dysphoria'. Dysphoria is experienced differently by different
   people and it can be both fixed (experienced consistently) and fluid
   (experienced partially or periodically). Some trans people report that
   their dysphoria is triggered when their gender is not affirmed by
   others (sometimes called `misgendering'), whilst others report that
   certain contexts, clothing types or body parts trigger their dysphoria.
   It is important to acknowledge that not all distress trans people feel
   may be dysphoria: trans people often bear a load of systemic
   discrimination which can lead to poorer mental health outcomes.

   We still do not know what makes some people trans, just as we do not
   know what makes some people cis or lesbian or even interested in sports
   or arts. Some academic fields are interested in debating how variations
   in gender diversity came to be, but the only thing that is clear is
   that transgender people are safer and happier when allowed to express
   themselves in a manner consistent with their gender identity. The best
   way to support transgender people is to let them lead their process of
   transition, which may include a need for others to respect their choice
   of name and pronouns, and reinforce their right to affirm their gender.

   Transition is a deeply personal journey that is often limited by
   circumstances and access to resources. Medical transition, for
   instance, is tightly controlled and might be geographically or
   financially inaccessible for some people. Sometimes other health issues
   can prevent a transgender person from doing all the things they wish to
   do to reinforce their gender identity. The process of medically
   transitioning can also be a very gradual one and differs from person to
   person. This may include choosing some treatments for a period of time
   and then choosing to stop (for example, using hormone therapy for a
   year, and then ceasing). It is important not to force expectations on
   transgender people but to allow them autonomy over their own lives and
   treat them with respect. If medically transitioning for example, is not
   something a person would like to pursue, this does not make them any
   `less' trans, but simply means their transition may look different from
   what is often expected of transgender people.

   Many statistics show alarmingly high rates of depression, anxiety and
   suicidality within the transgender community. Mental illness is often
   not associated directly with being transgender, but with the stigma and
   discrimination that transgender people face in daily life. These same
   statistics also show better mental health outcomes for those who are
   able to transition, as well as those who engage with transgender
   communities.

Key Points

     * Being transgender is not about being deceptive or "tricking"
       people, but presenting authentically to live a happier life .
     * How transgender people decide to affirm their gender is a personal
       choice. This may be a gradual process and may be limited by
       personal circumstances.
     * Trans people may choose diverse ways of expressing their gender,
       which can be influenced by particular circumstances. It may take
       someone a while to find the most comfortable way of expressing
       their gender. Be respectful of where a transgender person is at,
       and be sensitive to how they are choosing to express themselves at
       a given time.
     * It is very important to respect the names and pronouns trans people
       choose for themselves, especially if they do not fit societal views
       of male or female.
     * Transition and gender affirmation are positive processes that are
       beneficial to the mental health of trans people. Mental illness in
       the trans community is rooted in discrimination and the
       inaccessibility of transition procedures that many trans people
       face.

Transgender Glossary: Terms You Can Learn

     * (BUTTON)
     * (BUTTON)

   BY KATHY KATELLA March 21, 2022
   The vocabulary goes beyond appropriate pronouns.
   Transgender Pride Flag

   [Originally published: March 15, 2022. Updated: March 21, 2022]

   An entire vocabulary has evolved around people who are transgender, and
   if you're not familiar with the latest terms, you can easily hurt
   someone's feelings, even if that's not your intention. Figuring out a
   person's terms can be challenging--the lexicon includes words with
   meanings that have changed over time and could change again. And
   because each transgender person is navigating their own path, the best
   words to use in a conversation with them could vary depending on their
   circumstances.

   No one is expected to get this right at first, but you could make a
   huge difference to a transgender person by being knowledgeable and
   sensitive about language, says Christy Olezeski, PhD, director and
   co-founder of the Yale Pediatric Gender Program, which cares for
   transgender and nonbinary people up to the age of 25.

   "It's really about respect," Olezeski says. "This isn't anything new.
   Transgender and nonbinary people are everywhere."

   Olezeski and other Yale Medicine experts who care for transgender
   patients weighed in on a short guide to understanding terms related to
   the transgender experience, especially if you are a doctor or a
   transgender patient.

Which pronouns should you use?

   If you are not sure which name or pronouns a transgender person
   identifies with, you could introduce yourself and provide the pronouns
   you use to describe yourself. Then ask: "What is your name? Or what
   pronouns do you use?"

   Once you know, make sure to use their pronouns even when you are
   referring to an event that took place before they decided to make a
   transition. If you can't get confirmation, use "they" as a singular
   pronoun when describing a transgender person. The bottom line is to
   avoid making assumptions about a person's gender or pronouns.
     * He/Him/His and She/Her/Hers: These refer to the pronouns a person
       uses for themselves, whether or not they have made a transition.
     * They and Them: These pronouns are considered third-person singular
       when used to refer to someone who doesn't fit the strict
       definitions of male or female. These can also be used as nonbinary
       pronouns for individuals who identify outside of the gender binary
       (defined below).
     * Ze/Hir/Hirs: Pronouns that correspond with the traditional pronouns
       mentioned above (e.g., he/him/his, or she/her/hers). While not
       commonly used, they may be used to describe a person who doesn't
       identify within the gender binary.
     * Mx (pronounced "mix"): Used in place of Ms. or Mr. (People have
       used this term when they don't want to call attention to their
       gender, whether they are transgender or not.)

Gender identity terms to know

   A person's gender identity reflects their deeply felt, internal sense
   of self as far as their gender, whether or not it aligns with the one
   assigned to them at birth. It applies to all people, transgender or
   not.
     * LGBTQIA+: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex,
       asexual, and more.

     * Gender: Behavioral, cultural, and/or psychological ideas associated
       with a particular gender identity.

     * Gender binary: The idea that there are only two genders, male and
       female, and everyone must fall into one classification or the
       other.

     * Nonbinary: A person whose gender identity doesn't fit into the
       traditional gender binary structure of man or woman.

     * Agender: Adjective that describes someone who identifies as having
       no gender or who does not experience gender as a primary component
       of their identity.

     * Bigender: Adjective used to describe a person whose identity
       combines two genders or who may be sometimes male and sometimes
       female.

     * Cisgender: Adjective used to describe a person whose gender
       identity is congruent, in a traditional sense, with the sex
       assigned to them at birth.

     * Queer: An umbrella term for those who think of their gender
       identity or sexual orientation as being outside of societal norms.
       Once considered a derogatory term, "queer" has been reclaimed by
       many within the LGBTQIA+ community as a term of empowerment, but
       still may be considered offensive by some, especially if used by a
       person who is not in the community.

     * Gender expression: Ways of expressing and interpreting one's gender
       through clothes, hairstyles, mannerisms, body modifications, or
       name. Gender expression varies, depending on culture, context, and
       historical period.

     * Gender affirmation: The process of making changes to recognize,
       accept, and express one's gender identity. This might include any
       combination of social, legal, and/or medical changes that might
       range from changing one's way of dressing and hairstyle, to having
       gender-affirming surgery, to changing one's name and sex
       designation on legal documents.

     * Transgender (sometimes shortened to "trans"): Describes the full
       range of people who identify with a different gender than the sex
       assigned to them at birth. A trans person may or may not identify
       on the (traditional male or female) gender binary. They may or may
       not use hormones or undergo surgery to achieve a new gender
       identity.

     * Deadnaming: The practice of calling or referring to a transgender
       person by the name they used at a previous time in life and are no
       longer using, whether or not calling them by that name is
       intentional. The best practice is to use the name the person has
       chosen.

Terms for making a medical or surgical transition

   Every person's gender journey is unique. Some people make the
   transition with medical or surgical treatments, while others make the
   transition socially, changing the external expression of gender
   (hairstyle, clothing, etc.).

   Here are a few terms that can help.
     * Gender-affirming hormone therapy: Treatments that lead to the
       development of certain secondary sex characteristics. Depending on
       what the person is trying to achieve, they might include
       anti-androgens, estrogens, progestogens, or testosterone.

     * Gender-affirming surgeries: Surgical procedures that help people
       align their bodies to more closely match their gender identity.
       They may include chest and genital surgeries, body sculpting,
       facial feminization, and hair removal, among other treatments.

     * Gender-affirming genital surgery: A number of procedures that can
       be done to align the genitals and reproductive organs with a
       person's gender identity. ("Bottom surgery" is slang for
       gender-affirming genital surgery.)

     * Gender-affirming chest surgery: Surgery to either remove or
       construct a person's chest, depending on what they want to achieve.
       ("Top surgery" is slang for gender-affirming chest surgery.) One
       surgical procedure used to masculinize the chest--called a
       bilateral mastectomy--involves removing most of a person's breast
       tissue; it is often accompanied by repositioning of nipple areola
       and chest contouring.

     * Facial surgery: For a transgender woman, treatments may include
       Adam's apple reduction and procedures to reshape the nose or other
       areas of the face. Surgeries for a transgender man might include
       jaw augmentation or enhancement of the Adam's apple.

     * Breast augmentation: Using implants to enlarge the breasts.

Other words to know when talking to a doctor about transgender care

   Using appropriate terms can help medical providers discuss transgender
   care with their patients, as well as diagnose and treat transgender
   patients with more accuracy. This applies whether the patient is
   seeking gender-affirming treatment or routine ongoing medical care.
     * Assigned male or female at birth: The sex assigned to a newborn
       based on the physical structure of their genitals and other
       biological characteristics at birth, including everything related
       to reproduction, such as hormones, chromosomes, and certain
       internal organs.

     * Gender dysphoria: Distress experienced by some people whose gender
       identity and sex assigned at birth don't match. When this distress
       becomes significant, both the American Psychiatric Association
       (APA) and the American Medical Association (AMA) recognize it as a
       psychological diagnosis.

     * Intersex: From a medical perspective, the term describes a group of
       congenital (or at-birth) conditions in which the reproductive
       organs, genitals, and/or other sexual anatomy do not develop
       according to traditional expectations for females or males.
       Intersex can also be used as an identity term for someone with one
       of these conditions.

     * Transition: The process of moving from the gender assigned at birth
       to becoming aligned with another gender identity (which could be
       anywhere along the gender spectrum). This happens over time and the
       trajectory is unique to each transgender person. Some may make a
       "social transition," taking personal and legal steps such changing
       their name, pronouns, and gender expression, as well as telling
       family and friends, but undergo no medical interventions. Those who
       do make medical transitions may use hormone treatments to change
       their voice and distribution of body fat, among other
       characteristics. Some will have surgery to add or remove body parts
       related to the male or female genders.

     * Trans man (or transgender man): Someone assigned female sex at
       birth but now identifies as a boy/man/male, regardless of whether
       they have had surgery. Avoid using the term female-to-male (FTM).

     * Trans woman (or transgender woman): Someone who was assigned male
       sex at birth but now identifies as a girl/woman/female, regardless
       of whether they have had surgery. Avoid using the term
       male-to-female (MTF).
     * Transsexual: A term used sometimes in the medical literature or by
       some transgender people to describe people who have gone through
       the process of medical gender affirmation treatments (i.e.,
       gender-affirming hormones and surgeries).
     * Chosen name/Name used: The name a person chooses to use for
       themselves and wants others to use. This name may be different from
       the name on that person's identification or insurance documents.

Transgender terms to avoid

   There are other words that confuse the issue, including words in the
   LGBTQIA+ world that denote sexual attraction, and that some people
   mistakenly confuse with gender terms. These include gay, lesbian,
   bisexual, and pansexual (meaning attracted to people of all gender
   identities and biological sexes)--and they apply to transgender people
   in the same way they apply to cisgender people. In other words, a
   cisgender man who is attracted to other men is gay, and so is a
   transgender man who is attracted to other men.

   In addition, as experts learn more about the nuances of transgender
   issues, new terms have emerged to replace old ones that have come to be
   considered derogatory, disrespectful, or otherwise inappropriate. It
   may be best to simply ask people what terms they choose to use.

   Below are words to avoid:
     * Transvestite: A person who dresses in clothes of the opposite sex.
       A transgender person or cisgender person may or may not
       cross-dress. "Cross-dresser" is the preferable term.

     * Hermaphrodite: Once used to describe conditions some people are
       born with in which reproductive organs, structures, or tissue don't
       fit clear male or female definitions. The term "intersex" should be
       used instead.

     * Sex-change operation: Once used to describe a surgery that alters
       the body for a person transitioning from the sex they were assigned
       at birth. Better terms to use are "gender-affirming surgery," "sex
       reassignment surgery," or "gender confirmation surgery."

     * Tranny: Considered a slur. Instead, use "transgender people" or
       "transgender person."

Welcome to Transgender Trend.

Listen here to Founder and Director Stephanie Davies-Arai talking about the
harms of gender ideology for children and young people.

With thanks to FiLiA charity for this recording.

   "We have failed this generation of kids".
   Stephanie Davies-Arai talks to Benjamin Boyce about the new unreality
   we are living in, what we are doing to kids, the real function of
   puberty blockers and how The Tavistock Judicial Review has changed the
   world.
   Download

   Transgender Trend is the leading organisation in the call for
   evidence-based healthcare for children and young people suffering
   gender dysphoria and for factual, science-based teaching in schools.
   Our expertise was acknowledged recently when we were granted permission
   by the High Court to intervene in the Keira Bell v Tavistock & Portman
   NHS Trust judicial review.

   Established in 2015, Transgender Trend has led the way in advocating
   for the rights of children to reject gender stereotypes and be who they
   really are without discrimination, labelling or medical intervention to
   `fix' them.

   We believe all children have the right to go through puberty and reach
   adulthood with their fertility intact and that this is a fundamental
   human right.

   We believe that children with gender dysphoria deserve evidence-based
   treatment and have a right to the same duty of care as any other child.

   Our message is:

No child is born in the wrong body.

   Transgender Trend advocates for the most vulnerable children who are
   caught up in the recent trend in society to replace the objective
   reality of sex with the subjective idea of `gender identity' as the
   criteria for being a man or being a woman. `Gender identity' ideology
   teaches children who don't conform to masculine or feminine stereotypes
   that their personalities are `wrong' for their sex, and their bodies
   are then `wrong' for their gender identity.

   The number of children and young people who now believe they are really
   the opposite sex is reflected in the unprecedented recent trend in
   referrals to the Tavistock Gender Identity Development Service.

   Tavistock referrals

   Boys and girls should be able to wear what they like and have whatever
   interests they choose without adult interpretation through the lens of
   a non-scientific, ideological belief that human beings are born with an
   innate sense of being male or female, which is inevitably based on sex
   stereotypes.

   In school, acceptance of a boy who likes to play with dolls as a girl
   is no acceptance at all.

   Acceptance of a lesbian adolescent girl as a straight boy is no
   acceptance at all.

   This approach only serves to reinforce restrictive and harmful
   stereotypes. `Affirmation' is not kind, it affirms to a child that they
   are the wrong sex and encourages a child's belief that their body needs
   medically changing. Medical intervention can only ever effect cosmetic
   change; the child's sex remains the same.

   We advocate for the rights of lesbian and gay young people to grow up
   as lesbian or gay. We advocate for the rights of autistic children and
   those with mental health problems or background trauma to receive
   proper therapeutic care, not a `diagnosis' that they are really the
   opposite sex. All children and young people deserve treatment based on
   clinical evidence, not ideology.

   In schools all children deserve to be taught science-based facts, not
   ideology disguised as `fact'. All children have the right to privacy
   from the opposite sex in toilets and changing-rooms. Policy in schools
   must always put safeguarding first and schools should not use resources
   that confuse children about sex.

   Children should not be coerced into expressing a belief in `gender
   identity' through the threat that not to do so is `unkind' or
   `transphobic'.

A Proclamation on Transgender Day of Visibility

    1. Home
    2. Briefing Room
    3. Presidential Actions

        Transgender Day of Visibility celebrates the joy, strength, and
   absolute courage of some of the bravest people I know -- people who
   have too often had to put their jobs, relationships, and lives on the
   line just to be their true selves.  Today, we show millions of
   transgender and nonbinary Americans that we see them, they belong, and
   they should be treated with dignity and respect.  Their courage has
   given countless others strength, but no one should have to be brave
   just to be themselves.  Every American deserves that freedom.

        Transgender Americans shape our Nation's soul -- proudly serving
   in the military, curing deadly diseases, holding elected office,
   running thriving businesses, fighting for justice, raising families,
   and much more.  As kids, they deserve what every child deserves:  the
   chance to learn in safe and supportive schools, to develop meaningful
   friendships, and to live openly and honestly.  As adults, they deserve
   the same rights enjoyed by every American, including equal access to
   health care, housing, and jobs and the chance to age with grace as
   senior citizens.  But today, too many transgender Americans are still
   denied those rights and freedoms.  A wave of discriminatory State laws
   is targeting transgender youth, terrifying families and hurting kids
   who are not hurting anyone.  An epidemic of violence against
   transgender women and girls, in particular women and girls of color,
   has taken lives far too soon.  Last year's Club Q shooting in Colorado
   was another painful example of this kind of violence -- a stain on the
   conscience of our Nation.

        My Administration has fought to end these injustices from day one,
   working to ensure that transgender people and the entire LGBTQI+
   community can live openly and safely.  On my first day as President, I
   issued an Executive Order directing the Federal Government to root out
   discrimination against LGBTQI+ people and their families.  We have
   appointed a record number of openly LGBTQI+ leaders, and I was proud to
   rescind the ban on openly transgender people serving in the military.
   We are also working to make public spaces and travel more accessible,
   including with more inclusive gender markers on United States
   passports.  We are improving access to public services and entitlements
   like Social Security.  We are cracking down on discrimination in
   housing and education.  And last December, I signed the Respect for
   Marriage Act into law, ensuring that every American can marry the
   person they love and have that marriage accepted, period.

        Meanwhile, we are also working to ease the tremendous strain that
   discrimination, bullying, and harassment can put on transgender
   children -- more than half of whom seriously considered suicide in the
   last year.  The Department of Education is, for example, helping ensure
   that transgender students have equal opportunities to learn and thrive
   at school, and the Department of Justice is pushing back against
   extreme laws that seek to ban evidence-based gender-affirming health
   care.

        There is much more to do.  I continue to call on the Congress to
   finally pass the Equality Act and extend long-overdue civil rights
   protections to all LGBTQI+ Americans to ensure they can live with
   safety and dignity.  Together, we also have to keep challenging the
   hundreds of hateful State laws that have been introduced across the
   country, making sure every child knows that they are made in the image
   of God, that they are loved, and that we are standing up for them.

        America is founded on the idea that all people are created equal
   and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives.  We have
   never fully lived up to that, but we have never walked away from it
   either.  Today, as we celebrate transgender people, we also celebrate
   every American's fundamental right to be themselves, bringing us closer
   to realizing America's full promise.

        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
   States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
   Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
   March 31, 2023, as Transgender Day of Visibility.  I call upon all
   Americans to join us in lifting up the lives and voices of transgender
   people throughout our Nation and to work toward eliminating violence
   and discrimination against all transgender, gender nonconforming, and
   nonbinary people.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day
   of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three, and of the
   Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
   forty-seventh.

                                   JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

   Gender incongruence and transgender health in the ICD

What is the ICD?

   The International Classification serves to record and report health and
   health-related conditions globally. ICD ensures interoperability of
   digital health data, and their comparability. The ICD contains
   diseases, disorders, health conditions and much more. The inclusion of
   a specific category into ICD depends on utility to the different uses
   of ICD and sufficient evidence that a health condition exists.

ICD-11 and Gender Incongruence

   The 11^th edition of the International Statistical Classification of
   Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The newly revised ICD-11
   codes includes new changes to reflect modern understanding of sexual
   health and gender identity.

What does the ICD revision aim to do for transgender health?

   ICD-11 has redefined gender identity-related health, replacing outdated
   diagnostic categories like ICD-10's "transsexualism" and "gender
   identity disorder of children" with "gender incongruence of adolescence
   and adulthood" and "gender incongruence of childhood", respectively.
   Gender incongruence has been moved out of the "Mental and behavioural
   disorders" chapter and into the new "Conditions related to sexual
   health" chapter. This reflects current knowledge that trans-related and
   gender diverse identities are not conditions of mental ill-health, and
   that classifying them as such can cause enormous stigma.

   Inclusion of gender incongruence in the ICD-11 should ensure
   transgender people's access to gender-affirming health care, as well as
   adequate health insurance coverage for such services. Recognition in
   the ICD also acknowledges the links between gender identity, sexual
   behaviour, exposure to violence and sexually transmitted infections.

What is Gender Incongruence?

   The bulk of the changes centered around the moving of "gender
   incongruence" from a classification of mental health to one of sexual
   health. In 2020, we have a better understanding of the issues
   surrounding this condition, and they are not related to a mental health
   condition.  Treating gender incongruence in a mental health chapter was
   causing additional stigma for an already stigmatized condition. WHO
   officials added the hope that adding this condition to a sexual health
   chapter of the ICD codes would "help increase access to care for health
   interventions" and "destigmatize the condition."

What is transgender and what are the main health concerns of transgender
people?

   Transgender people share many of the same health needs as the general
   population, but may have other specialist health-care needs, such as
   gender-affirming hormone therapy and surgery. However, evidence
   suggests that transgender people often experience a disproportionately
   high burden of disease, including in the domains of mental, sexual and
   reproductive health. Some transgender people seek medical or surgical
   transition, others do not.

What is gender-affirmative health care?

   Gender-affirmative health care can include any single or combination of
   a number of social, psychological, behavioural or medical (including
   hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and
   affirm an individual's gender identity.
