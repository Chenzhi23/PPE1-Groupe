Why Lawmakers and Business Leaders Need to Look at Green Behaviour
            As someone who cares for the environment, you know that
            recycling, turning down the heating and walking to work is
            good for the planet. Those individual acts are important on
            our journey to net zero. But to have a lasting impact, we need
            to have bigger and bolder ideas about behaviour change. “In
            the Gender Equality Index , we see...

Gender Equality Index 2023: Towards a green transition in transport and
energy
            The Gender Equality Index 2023 presents the EU in relation to
            gender equality amid crises and uncertainties. In recent
            years, the world has been hit by repeated shocks and multiple
            crises. What remains constant is the fact that when crisis
            strikes, women and girls suffer disproportionally. The crises
            and shocks continuously threaten to create new challenges and
            reverse years of...

Gender-sensitive communication
            This toolkit provides guidelines for the use of
            gender-sensitive language in writing. Gender-sensitive
            communication ensures that women and men – and those who do
            not conform to the binary gender system – are treated as
            persons of equal importance and dignity.

What does it take to achieve gender equality? – Resources and structures key
for women's empowerment
            With International Women’s Day just around the corner,
            progress towards gender equality is high on the agenda. But
            what does it take to really pave the way for gender equality?

GRPP: Four letters can unlock €2 trillion to accelerate our drive towards
gender equality
            Each year the EU spends 14% of its Gross Domestic Product
            (GDP) on public works, from building projects to social
            infrastructure. Smart targeting of that €2 trillion in public
            funds and considering how it impacts the lives of both women
            and men is the essence of Gender-responsive public
            procurement, or GRPP.
