A Proclamation on Transgender Day of Visibility

    1. Home
    2. Briefing Room
    3. Presidential Actions

        Transgender Day of Visibility celebrates the joy, strength, and
   absolute courage of some of the bravest people I know — people who have
   too often had to put their jobs, relationships, and lives on the line
   just to be their true selves.  Today, we show millions of transgender
   and nonbinary Americans that we see them, they belong, and they should
   be treated with dignity and respect.  Their courage has given countless
   others strength, but no one should have to be brave just to be
   themselves.  Every American deserves that freedom.

        Transgender Americans shape our Nation’s soul — proudly serving in
   the military, curing deadly diseases, holding elected office, running
   thriving businesses, fighting for justice, raising families, and much
   more.  As kids, they deserve what every child deserves:  the chance to
   learn in safe and supportive schools, to develop meaningful
   friendships, and to live openly and honestly.  As adults, they deserve
   the same rights enjoyed by every American, including equal access to
   health care, housing, and jobs and the chance to age with grace as
   senior citizens.  But today, too many transgender Americans are still
   denied those rights and freedoms.  A wave of discriminatory State laws
   is targeting transgender youth, terrifying families and hurting kids
   who are not hurting anyone.  An epidemic of violence against
   transgender women and girls, in particular women and girls of color,
   has taken lives far too soon.  Last year’s Club Q shooting in Colorado
   was another painful example of this kind of violence — a stain on the
   conscience of our Nation.

        My Administration has fought to end these injustices from day one,
   working to ensure that transgender people and the entire LGBTQI+
   community can live openly and safely.  On my first day as President, I
   issued an Executive Order directing the Federal Government to root out
   discrimination against LGBTQI+ people and their families.  We have
   appointed a record number of openly LGBTQI+ leaders, and I was proud to
   rescind the ban on openly transgender people serving in the military.
   We are also working to make public spaces and travel more accessible,
   including with more inclusive gender markers on United States
   passports.  We are improving access to public services and entitlements
   like Social Security.  We are cracking down on discrimination in
   housing and education.  And last December, I signed the Respect for
   Marriage Act into law, ensuring that every American can marry the
   person they love and have that marriage accepted, period.

        Meanwhile, we are also working to ease the tremendous strain that
   discrimination, bullying, and harassment can put on transgender
   children — more than half of whom seriously considered suicide in the
   last year.  The Department of Education is, for example, helping ensure
   that transgender students have equal opportunities to learn and thrive
   at school, and the Department of Justice is pushing back against
   extreme laws that seek to ban evidence-based gender-affirming health
   care.

        There is much more to do.  I continue to call on the Congress to
   finally pass the Equality Act and extend long-overdue civil rights
   protections to all LGBTQI+ Americans to ensure they can live with
   safety and dignity.  Together, we also have to keep challenging the
   hundreds of hateful State laws that have been introduced across the
   country, making sure every child knows that they are made in the image
   of God, that they are loved, and that we are standing up for them.

        America is founded on the idea that all people are created equal
   and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives.  We have
   never fully lived up to that, but we have never walked away from it
   either.  Today, as we celebrate transgender people, we also celebrate
   every American’s fundamental right to be themselves, bringing us closer
   to realizing America’s full promise.

        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
   States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
   Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
   March 31, 2023, as Transgender Day of Visibility.  I call upon all
   Americans to join us in lifting up the lives and voices of transgender
   people throughout our Nation and to work toward eliminating violence
   and discrimination against all transgender, gender nonconforming, and
   nonbinary people.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day
   of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three, and of the
   Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
   forty-seventh.

                                   JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
