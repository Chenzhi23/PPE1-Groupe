   A transgender person (often shortened to trans) is someone whose gender
   identity differs from that typically associated with the sex they were
   assigned at birth.^[1] Some transgender people who desire medical
   assistance to transition from one sex to another identify as
   transsexual.^[2]^[3] Transgender is an umbrella term; in addition to
   including people whose gender identity is the opposite of their
   assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may also include people
   who are non-binary or genderqueer.^[4]^[5]^[6] Other definitions of
   transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or else
   conceptualize transgender people as a third gender.^[7]^[8] The term
   transgender may be defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.^[9]

   Being transgender is distinct from sexual orientation.^[10] Transgender
   people may identify as heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay or
   lesbian), bisexual, asexual, or otherwise, or may decline to label
   their sexual orientation. The opposite of transgender is cisgender,
   which describes persons whose gender identity matches their assigned
   sex.^[11] Accurate statistics on the number of transgender people vary
   widely,^[12] in part due to different definitions of what constitutes
   being transgender.^[13] Some countries, such as Canada, collect census
   data on transgender people.^[14] Generally, fewer than 1% of the
   worldwide population are transgender, with figures ranging from <0.1%
   to 0.6%.^[15]^[16]^[17]

   The degree to which individuals feel genuine, authentic, and
   comfortable within their external appearance and accept their genuine
   identity has been called gender congruence.^[18] Many transgender
   people experience gender dysphoria, and some seek medical treatments
   such as hormone replacement therapy, sex reassignment surgery, or
   psychotherapy.^[19] Not all transgender people desire these treatments,
   and some cannot undergo them for financial or medical
   reasons.^[19]^[20]

   Many transgender people face discrimination in the workplace^[21] and
   in accessing public accommodations^[22] and healthcare.^[23] In many
   places, they are not legally protected from discrimination.^[24]

Terminology

   Before the mid-20th century various terms were used within and beyond
   Western medical and psychological sciences to identify persons and
   identities labeled transsexual, and later transgender from mid-century
   onward.^[5]^[27] Imported from the German and ultimately modeled after
   German Transsexualismus (coined in 1923),^[28] the English term
   transsexual has enjoyed international acceptability, though transgender
   has been increasingly preferred over transsexual.^[29] The word
   transgender acquired its modern umbrella term meaning in the
   1990s.^[30]^[31]

  Transgender

   Psychiatrist John F. Oliven of Columbia University used the term
   transgenderism in his 1965 reference work Sexual Hygiene and
   Pathology,^[32]^[33]^[34] writing that the term which had previously
   been used, transsexualism, "is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism'
   is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary
   transvestism."^[35]^[36] The term transgender was then popularized with
   varying definitions by various transgender, transsexual, and
   transvestite people, including Virginia Prince,^[2] who used
   transgenderal^[37] in the December 1969 issue of Transvestia, a
   national magazine for cross-dressers she founded.^[38] By the mid-1970s
   both trans-gender and trans people were in use as umbrella terms,^[note
   1] while transgenderist and transgenderal were used to refer to people
   who wanted to live cross-gender without sex reassignment surgery
   (SRS).^[39] By 1976, transgenderist was abbreviated as TG in
   educational materials.^[40]^[verification needed]

   By 1984, the concept of a "transgender community" had developed, in
   which transgender was used as an umbrella term.^[41] In 1985, Richard
   Elkins established the "Trans-Gender Archive" at the University of
   Ulster.^[38] By 1992, the International Conference on Transgender Law
   and Employment Policy defined transgender as an expansive umbrella term
   including "transsexuals, transgenderists, cross dressers", and anyone
   transitioning.^[42] Leslie Feinberg's pamphlet, "Transgender
   Liberation: A Movement Whose Time has Come", circulated in 1992,
   identified transgender as a term to unify all forms of gender
   nonconformity; in this way transgender has become synonymous with
   queer.^[43] In 1994, gender theorist Susan Stryker defined transgender
   as encompassing "all identities or practices that cross over, cut
   across, move between, or otherwise queer socially constructed
   sex/gender boundaries", including, but not limited to, "transsexuality,
   heterosexual transvestism, gay drag, butch lesbianism, and such
   non-European identities as the Native American berdache or the Indian
   Hijra".^[44]

   Between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s, the primary terms used under
   the transgender umbrella were "female to male" (FtM) for men who
   transitioned from female to male, and "male to female" (MtF) for women
   who transitioned from male to female. These terms have been superseded
   by "trans man" and "trans woman", respectively.^[45] This shift in
   preference from terms highlighting biological sex ("transsexual",
   "FtM") to terms highlighting gender identity and expression
   ("transgender", "trans man") reflects a broader shift in the
   understanding of transgender people's sense of self and the increasing
   recognition of those who decline medical reassignment as part of the
   transgender community.^[45]

   Transgender can also refer specifically to a person whose gender
   identity is opposite (rather than different from) the sex the person
   had or was identified as having at birth.^[46]^[47]^[48]^[49]

   Transfeminine
   is a term for any person, binary or non-binary, who was assigned male
   at birth and has a predominantly feminine gender identity or
   presentation.^[50]

   Transmasculine refers to a person assigned female at birth who has a
   predominantly masculine gender identity or presentation.^[50]

   Transgendered is a common term in older literature. Many within the
   transgender community deprecate it on the basis that transgender is an
   adjective, not a verb.^[51] Organizations such as GLAAD and The
   Guardian also state that transgender should never be used as a noun
   (e.g., "Max is transgender" or "Max is a transgender man", not "Max is
   a transgender").^[5]^[52] "Transgender" is also a noun for the broader
   topic of transgender identity and experience.^[53]

   Although the term "transgenderism" was once considered acceptable, it
   has come to be viewed as offensive, according to GLAAD.^[54] In 2020
   the International Journal of Transgenderism changed its name to the
   International Journal of Transgender Health "to reflect a change toward
   more appropriate and acceptable use of language in our field."^[55]

   Health-practitioner manuals, professional journalistic style guides,
   and LGBT advocacy groups advise the adoption by others of the name and
   pronouns identified by the person in question, including present
   references to the transgender person's past.^[56]^[57]

   In contrast, people whose sense of personal identity corresponds to the
   sex and gender assigned to them at birth – that is, those who are
   neither transgender nor non-binary or genderqueer – are called
   cisgender.^[58]

  Transsexual

   See also: Transsexual § Terminology

   Inspired by Magnus Hirschfeld's 1923 term seelischer Transsexualismus,
   the term transsexual was introduced to English in 1949 by David Oliver
   Cauldwell^[note 2] and popularized by Harry Benjamin in 1966, around
   the same time transgender was coined and began to be popularized.^[2]
   Since the 1990s, transsexual has generally been used to refer to the
   subset of transgender people^[2]^[59]^[60] who desire to transition
   permanently to the gender with which they identify and who seek medical
   assistance (for example, sex reassignment surgery) with this.

   Distinctions between the terms transgender and transsexual are commonly
   based on distinctions between gender and sex.^[61]^[62] Transsexuality
   may be said to deal more with physical aspects of one's sex, while
   transgender considerations deal more with one's psychological gender
   disposition or predisposition, as well as the related social
   expectations that may accompany a given gender role.^[63] Many
   transgender people reject the term transsexual.^[3]^[64]^[5] Christine
   Jorgensen publicly rejected transsexual in 1979 and instead identified
   herself in newsprint as trans-gender, saying, "gender doesn't have to
   do with bed partners, it has to do with identity."^[65]^[66] Some have
   objected to the term transsexual on the basis that it describes a
   condition related to gender identity rather than
   sexuality.^[67]^[better source needed]^[note 3]^[failed verification]
   Some transsexual people object to being included in the transgender
   umbrella.^[68]^[69]^[70]

   In his 2007 book Imagining Transgender: An Ethnography of a Category,
   anthropologist David Valentine asserts that transgender was coined and
   used by activists to include many people who do not necessarily
   identify with the term and states that people who do not identify with
   the term transgender should not be included in the transgender
   spectrum.^[68] Leslie Feinberg likewise asserts that transgender is not
   a self-identifier (for some people) but a category imposed by observers
   to understand other people.^[69] According to the Transgender Health
   Program (THP) at Fenway Health in Boston, there are no
   universally-accepted definitions, and confusion is common because terms
   that were popular at the turn of the 21st century may have since been
   deemed offensive. The THP recommends that clinicians ask clients what
   terminology they prefer, and avoid the term transsexual unless they are
   sure that a client is comfortable with it.^[67]^[undue weight? –

   Harry Benjamin invented a classification system for transsexuals and
   transvestites, called the Sex Orientation Scale (SOS), in which he
   assigned transsexuals and transvestites to one of six categories based
   on their reasons for cross-dressing and the relative urgency of their
   need (if any) for sex reassignment surgery.^[71] Contemporary views on
   gender identity and classification differ markedly from Harry
   Benjamin's original opinions.^[72] Sexual orientation is no longer
   regarded as a criterion for diagnosis, or for distinction between
   transsexuality, transvestism and other forms of gender-variant behavior
   and expression. Benjamin's scale was designed for use with heterosexual
   trans women, and trans men's identities do not align with its
   categories.^[73]

  Sexual orientation

   Main article: Transgender sexuality

   Gender, gender identity, and being transgender are distinct concepts
   from sexual orientation.^[74] Sexual orientation is an individual's
   enduring pattern of attraction, or lack thereof, to others (being
   straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, etc.), whereas gender
   identity is a person's innate knowledge of their own gender (being a
   man, woman, non-binary, etc.).^[54] Transgender people can have any
   orientation, and generally use labels corresponding to their gender,
   rather than assigned sex at birth. For example, trans women who are
   exclusively attracted to other women commonly identify as lesbians, and
   trans men exclusively attracted to women would identify as
   straight.^[54] Many trans people describe their sexual orientation as
   queer, in addition to or instead of, other terms.^[75]^[76]^[77]

   For much of the 20th century, transgender identity was conflated with
   homosexuality and transvestism.^[78]^[79] In earlier academic
   literature, sexologists used the labels homosexual and heterosexual
   transsexual to categorize transgender individuals' sexual orientation
   based on their birth sex.^[80] Critics consider these terms
   "heterosexist",^[81] "archaic",^[82] and demeaning.^[83] Newer
   literature often uses terms such as attracted to men (androphilic),
   attracted to women (gynephilic), attracted to both (bisexual), or
   attracted to neither (asexual) to describe a person's sexual
   orientation without reference to their gender identity.^[84] Therapists
   are coming to understand the necessity of using terms with respect to
   their clients' gender identities and preferences.^[85]

   The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey reported that of the 27,715
   transgender and non-binary respondents, 21% said queer best described
   their sexual orientation, 18% said pansexual, 16% said gay, lesbian, or
   same-gender-loving, 15% said straight, 14% said bisexual, and 10% said
   asexual.^[76] A 2019 Canadian survey of 2,873 trans and non-binary
   people found that 51% described their sexual orientation as queer, 13%
   as asexual, 28% as bisexual, 13% as gay, 15% as lesbian, 31% as
   pansexual, 8% as straight or heterosexual, 4% as two-spirit, and 9% as
   unsure or questioning.^[77]

Related identities and practices

  Non-binary identity

   Main articles: Non-binary gender and Androgyny

   Some non-binary (or genderqueer) people identify as transgender. These
   identities are not specifically male or female. They can be agender,
   androgynous, bigender, pangender, or genderfluid,^[86] and exist
   outside of cisnormativity.^[87]^[88] Bigender and androgynous are
   overlapping categories; bigender individuals may identify as moving
   between male and female roles (genderfluid) or as being both masculine
   and feminine simultaneously (androgynous), and androgynes may similarly
   identify as beyond gender or genderless (agender), between genders
   (intergender), moving across genders (genderfluid), or simultaneously
   exhibiting multiple genders (pangender).^[89] Non-binary gender
   identities are independent of sexual orientation.^[90]^[91]

  Transvestism and cross-dressing

   Main article: Transvestism

   A transvestite is a person who cross-dresses, or dresses in clothes
   typically associated with the gender opposite the one they were
   assigned at birth.^[92]^[93] The term transvestite is used as a synonym
   for the term cross-dresser,^[94]^[95] although cross-dresser is
   generally considered the preferred term.^[95]^[96] The term
   cross-dresser is not exactly defined in the relevant literature.
   Michael A. Gilbert, professor at the Department of Philosophy, York
   University, Toronto, offers this definition: "[A cross-dresser] is a
   person who has an apparent gender identification with one sex, and who
   has and certainly has been birth-designated as belonging to [that] sex,
   but who wears the clothing of the opposite sex because it is that of
   the opposite sex."^[97] This definition excludes people "who wear
   opposite sex clothing for other reasons", such as "those female
   impersonators who look upon dressing as solely connected to their
   livelihood, actors undertaking roles, individual males and females
   enjoying a masquerade, and so on. These individuals are cross dressing
   but are not cross dressers."^[98] Cross-dressers may not identify with,
   want to be, or adopt the behaviors or practices of the opposite gender
   and generally do not want to change their bodies medically or
   surgically. The majority of cross-dressers identify as
   heterosexual.^[99]

   The term transvestite and the associated outdated term transvestism are
   conceptually different from the term transvestic fetishism, as
   transvestic fetishist refers to those who intermittently use clothing
   of the opposite gender for fetishistic purposes.^[100]^[101] In medical
   terms, transvestic fetishism is differentiated from cross-dressing by
   use of the separate codes 302.3 in the Diagnostic and Statistical
   Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)^[101] and F65.1 in the
   ICD.^[100]^[needs update]

  Drag

   See also: Drag king, Drag queen, and Faux queen

   [220px-Victoria_Sin%2C_sandwich.jpg] A drag queen performer

   Drag is clothing and makeup worn on special occasions for performing or
   entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for
   other reasons.^[102] Drag performance includes overall presentation and
   behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical,
   comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of
   women by second-wave feminism. Drag artists have a long tradition in
   LGBT culture.

   Generally the term drag queen covers men doing female drag, drag king
   covers women doing male drag, and faux queen covers women doing female
   drag.^[103]^[104] Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders
   and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Drag performers are
   not inherently transgender. Some drag performers, transvestites, and
   people in the gay community have embraced the pornographically derived
   term tranny for drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or
   cross-dressing; this term is widely considered an offensive slur if
   applied to transgender people.

History

   Main articles: Transgender history and Third gender

   A precise history of the global occurrence of transgender people is
   difficult to assess because the modern concept of being transgender,
   and of gender in general in relation to transgender identity, did not
   develop until the mid-1900s. Historical depictions, records and
   understandings are inherently filtered through modern principles, and
   were largely viewed through a medical and (often outsider)
   anthropological lens until the late 1900s.^[105]^[106]

   Some historians consider the Roman emperor Elagabalus to have been
   transgender. Elagabalus was reported to have dressed in a feminine
   manner, preferred to be called "Lady" instead of "Lord" and may have
   even sought a primitive form of gender-affirming
   surgery.^[107]^[108]^[109]^[110]^[111]^[excessive citations]

   Worldwide, a number of societies have had traditional third gender
   roles, some of which continue in some form into the present
   day.^[112]The Hippocratic Corpus (interpreting the writing of
   Herodotus) describes the "disease of the Scythians" (regarding the
   Enaree), which it attributes to impotency due to riding on a horse
   without stirrups. This reference was well discussed by medical writings
   of the 1500s–1700s. Pierre Petit writing in 1596 viewed the "Scythian
   disease" as natural variation, but by the 1700s writers viewed it as a
   "melancholy", or "hysterical" psychiatric disease. By the early 1800s,
   being transgender separate from Hippocrates' idea of it was claimed to
   be widely known, but remained poorly documented. Both trans women and
   trans men were cited in European insane asylums of the early 1800s. One
   of the earliest recorded transgender people in America was Thomas(ine)
   Hall, a seventeenth century colonial servant.^[113] The most complete
   account of the time came from the life of the Chevalier d'Éon
   (1728–1810), a French diplomat. As cross-dressing became more
   widespread in the late 1800s, discussion of transgender people
   increased greatly and writers attempted to explain the origins of being
   transgender. Much study came out of Germany, and was exported to other
   Western audiences. Cross-dressing was seen in a pragmatic light until
   the late 1800s; it had previously served a satirical or disguising
   purpose. But in the latter half of the 1800s, cross-dressing and being
   transgender became viewed as an increasing societal danger.^[105]

   William A. Hammond wrote an 1882 account of transgender Pueblo
   "shamans" [sic] (mujerados), comparing them to the Scythian disease.
   Other writers of the late 1700s and 1800s (including Hammond's
   associates in the American Neurological Association) had noted the
   widespread nature of transgender cultural practices among native
   peoples. Explanations varied, but authors generally did not ascribe
   native transgender practices to psychiatric causes, instead condemning
   the practices in a religious and moral sense. Native groups provided
   much study on the subject, and perhaps the majority of all study until
   after WWII.^[105]

   Critical studies first began to emerge in the late 1800s in Germany,
   with the works of Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfeld coined the term
   "transvestite" in 1910 as the scope of transgender study grew. His work
   would lead to the 1919 founding of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft
   in Berlin. Though Hirscheld's legacy is disputed, he revolutionized the
   field of study. The Institut was destroyed when the Nazis seized power
   in 1933, and its research was infamously burned in the May 1933 Nazi
   book burnings.^[114] Transgender issues went largely out of the public
   eye until after World War II. Even when they re-emerged, they reflected
   a forensic psychology approach, unlike the more sexological that had
   been employed in the lost German research.^[105]^[115]

Healthcare

   Main article: Transgender health care

   Further information: Gender transition

  Mental healthcare

   People who experience discord between their gender and the expectations
   of others or whose gender identity conflicts with their body may
   benefit by talking through their feelings in depth. While individuals
   may find counseling or psychotherapy helpful, it is no longer
   recommended as a prerequisite for further transition steps.^[116]
   Research on gender identity with regard to psychology, and scientific
   understanding of the phenomenon and its related issues, is relatively
   new.^[117]^[needs update?] The term gender incongruence is listed in
   the ICD by the WHO. In the American (DSM), the term gender dysphoria is
   listed under code F64.0 for adolescents and adults, and F64.2 for
   children.^[118]
   (Further information: Causes of gender incongruence.)

   France removed gender identity disorder as a diagnosis by decree in
   2010,^[119]^[120] but according to French trans rights organizations,
   beyond the impact of the announcement itself, nothing changed.^[121] In
   2017, the Danish parliament abolished the F64 Gender identity
   disorders. The DSM-5 refers to the topic as gender dysphoria (GD) while
   reinforcing the idea that being transgender is not considered a mental
   illness.^[122]

   Transgender people may meet the criteria for a diagnosis of gender
   dysphoria "only if [being transgender] causes distress or
   disability."^[123] This distress may manifest as depression or
   inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This
   diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that all transgender
   people suffer from GD, which has confused transgender people and those
   who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are
   comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing
   inner frustration or impairing their functioning do not suffer from GD.
   Moreover, GD is not necessarily permanent and is often resolved through
   therapy or transitioning. Feeling oppressed by the negative attitudes
   and behaviours of such others as legal entities does not indicate GD.
   GD does not imply an opinion of immorality; the psychological
   establishment holds that people with any kind of mental or emotional
   problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GD is whatever will
   alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this solution often, but
   not always, consists of undergoing a gender transition.^[117]

   Clinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to
   adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of
   practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this
   population of individuals.^[124] Many mental healthcare providers know
   little about transgender issues. Those who seek help from these
   professionals often educate the professional without receiving
   help.^[117] This solution usually is good for transsexual people but is
   not the solution for other transgender people, particularly non-binary
   people who lack an exclusively male or female identity. Instead,
   therapists can support their clients in whatever steps they choose to
   take to transition or can support their decision not to transition
   while also addressing their clients' sense of congruence between gender
   identity and appearance.^[18]

   Research on the specific problems faced by the transgender community in
   mental health has focused on diagnosis and clinicians' experiences
   instead of transgender clients' experiences.^[125] Therapy was not
   always sought by transgender people due to mental health needs. Prior
   to the seventh version of the Standards of Care (SOC), an individual
   had to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder in order to proceed
   with hormone treatments or sexual reassignment surgery. The new version
   decreased the focus on diagnosis and instead emphasized the importance
   of flexibility in order to meet the diverse health care needs of
   transsexual, transgender, and all gender-nonconforming people.^[126]

   The reasons for seeking mental health services vary according to the
   individual. A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily
   mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of
   dealing with stigma and experiencing transphobia pushes many
   transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life,
   as one trans woman reflected: "Transgendered individuals are going to
   come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do,
   specifically, with being transgendered. It has to do because they've
   had to hide, they've had to lie, and they've felt all of this guilt and
   shame, unfortunately usually for years!"^[125] Many transgender people
   also seek mental health treatment for depression and anxiety caused by
   the stigma attached to being transgender, and some transgender people
   have stressed the importance of acknowledging their gender identity
   with a therapist in order to discuss other quality-of-life
   issues.^[125] Rarely, some choose to detransition.^[127]

   Problems still remain surrounding misinformation about transgender
   issues that hurt transgender people's mental health experiences. One
   trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate
   program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training:
   "Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe
   that's it. I don't think I've had any formal training just going
   through [clinical] programs ... I don't think most [therapists] know.
   Most therapists – Master's degree, PhD level – they've had ... one
   diversity class on GLBT issues. One class out of the huge diversity
   training. One class. And it was probably mostly about gay
   lifestyle."^[125] Many health insurance policies do not cover treatment
   associated with gender transition, and numerous people are under- or
   uninsured, which raises concerns about the insufficient training most
   therapists receive prior to working with transgender clients,
   potentially increasing financial strain on clients without providing
   the treatment they need.^[125] Many clinicians who work with
   transgender clients only receive mediocre training on gender identity,
   but introductory training on interacting with transgender people has
   recently been made available to health care professionals to help
   remove barriers and increase the level of service for the transgender
   population.^[128] In February 2010, France became the first country in
   the world to remove transgender identity from the list of mental
   diseases.^[129]^[130]

   A 2014 study carried out by the Williams Institute (a UCLA think tank)
   found that 41% of transgender people had attempted suicide, with the
   rate being higher among people who experienced discrimination in access
   to housing or healthcare, harassment, physical or sexual assault, or
   rejection by family.^[131] A 2019 follow-up study found that
   transgender people who wanted and received gender-affirming medical
   care had substantially lower rates of suicidal thoughts and
   attempts.^[132] However, a study on the impact of parental support on
   trans youth found that among trans children with supportive parents,
   only 4% attempted suicide, a 93% decrease.^[133]

   Autism is more common in people who are gender dysphoric. It is not
   known whether there is a biological basis. This may be due to the fact
   that people on the autism spectrum are less concerned with societal
   disapproval, and feel less fear or inhibition about coming out as trans
   than others.^[134]^[better source needed]

  Physical healthcare

   Medical and surgical procedures exist for transsexual and some
   transgender people, though most categories of transgender people as
   described above are not known for seeking the following treatments.
   Hormone replacement therapy for trans men induces beard growth and
   masculinizes skin, hair, voice, and fat distribution. Hormone
   replacement therapy for trans women feminizes fat distribution and
   breasts, as well as diminishes muscle mass and strength. Laser hair
   removal or electrolysis removes excess hair for trans women. Surgical
   procedures for trans women feminize the voice, skin, face, Adam's
   apple, breasts, waist, buttocks, and genitals. Surgical procedures for
   trans men masculinize the chest and genitals and remove the womb,
   ovaries, and fallopian tubes. The acronyms "Gender-affirming surgery
   (GAS)" and "sex reassignment surgery" (SRS) refer to genital surgery.
   The term "sex reassignment therapy" (SRT) is used as an umbrella term
   for physical procedures required for transition. Use of the term "sex
   change" has been criticized for its emphasis on surgery, and the term
   "transition" is preferred.^[5]^[135] Availability of these procedures
   depends on degree of gender dysphoria, presence or absence of gender
   identity disorder,^[136] and standards of care in the relevant
   jurisdiction.

   Trans men who have not had a hysterectomy and who take testosterone are
   at increased risk for endometrial cancer because androstenedione, which
   is made from testosterone in the body, can be converted into estrogen,
   and external estrogen is a risk factor for endometrial cancer.^[137]

  Detransition

   Main article: Detransition

   Detransition refers to the cessation or reversal of a sex reassignment
   surgery or gender transition. Formal studies of detransition have been
   few in number,^[138] of disputed quality,^[139] and politically
   controversial.^[140] Estimates of the rate at which detransitioning
   occurs vary from less than 1% to as high as 13%.^[141] Those who
   undergo sex reassignment surgery have very low rates of detransition or
   regret.^[127]^[142]^[143]^[144]

   The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, with responses from 27,715
   individuals who identified as "transgender, trans, genderqueer, [or]
   non-binary", found that 8% of respondents reported some kind of
   detransition. "Most of those who de-transitioned did so only
   temporarily: 62% of those who had de-transitioned reported that they
   were currently living full time in a gender different than the gender
   they were thought to be at birth."^[76] Detransition was associated
   with assigned male sex at birth, nonbinary gender identity, and
   bisexual orientation, among other cohorts.^[143] Only 5% of
   detransitioners (or 0.4% of total respondents) reported doing so
   because gender transition was "not for them"; 82% cited external
   reason(s), including pressure from others, the difficulties of
   transition, and discrimination. "The most common reason cited for
   de-transitioning was pressure from a parent (36%)."^[145]^[146]^[76]

   Main article: Transgender rights

   Further information: Legal recognition of non-binary gender

   Legal procedures exist in some jurisdictions which allow individuals to
   change their legal gender or name to reflect their gender identity.
   Requirements for these procedures vary from an explicit formal
   diagnosis of transsexualism, to a diagnosis of gender identity
   disorder, to a letter from a physician that attests the individual's
   gender transition or having established a different gender role.^[147]
   In 1994, the DSM IV entry was changed from "Transsexual" to "Gender
   Identity Disorder". In 2013, the DSM V removed "Gender Identity
   Disorder" and published "Gender Dysphoria" in its place.^[148] In many
   places, transgender people are not legally protected from
   discrimination in the workplace or in public accommodations.^[24] A
   report released in February 2011 found that 90% of transgender people
   faced discrimination at work and were unemployed at double the rate of
   the general population,^[22] and over half had been harassed or turned
   away when attempting to access public services.^[22] Members of the
   transgender community also encounter high levels of discrimination in
   health care.^[149]

  Europe

   A Welsh Government advisory video on transgender hate crimes

   36 countries in Europe require a mental health diagnosis for legal
   gender recognition and 20 countries require sterilisation.^[150] In
   April 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that requiring
   sterilisation for legal gender recognition violates human rights.^[151]

  Canada

   Main article: Transgender rights in Canada

   Jurisdiction over legal classification of sex in Canada is assigned to
   the provinces and territories. This includes legal change of gender
   classification. On June 19, 2017, Bill C-16, having passed the
   legislative process in the House of Commons of Canada and the Senate of
   Canada, became law upon receiving Royal Assent, which put it into
   immediate force.^[152]^[153]^[154] The law updated the Canadian Human
   Rights Act and the Criminal Code to include "gender identity and gender
   expression" as protected grounds from discrimination, hate publications
   and advocating transgender genocide. The bill also added "gender
   identity and expression" to the list of aggravating factors in
   sentencing, where the accused commits a criminal offence against an
   individual because of those personal characteristics. Similar
   transgender laws also exist in all the provinces and territories.^[155]

  United States

   Main article: Transgender rights in the United States

   In the United States, transgender people are protected from employment
   discrimination by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Exceptions
   apply to certain types of employers, for example, employers with fewer
   than 15 employees and religious organizations.^[156] In 2020, the U.S.
   Supreme Court affirmed that Title VII prohibits discrimination against
   transgender people in the case R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v.
   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.^[157]

   Nicole Maines, a trans girl, took a case to Maine's supreme court in
   June 2013. She argued that being denied access to her high school's
   women's restroom was a violation of Maine's Human Rights Act; one state
   judge has disagreed with her,^[158] but Maines won her lawsuit against
   the Orono school district in January 2014 before the Maine Supreme
   Judicial Court.^[159] On May 14, 2016, the United States Department of
   Education and Department of Justice issued guidance directing public
   schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their
   gender identities.^[160]

   On June 30, 2016, the United States Department of Defense removed the
   ban that prohibited transgender people from openly serving in the US
   military.^[161] On July 27, 2017, President Donald Trump tweeted that
   transgender Americans would not be allowed to serve "in any capacity"
   in the United States Armed Forces.^[162] Later that day, Joint Chiefs
   of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford announced, "there will be no
   modifications to the current policy until the president's direction has
   been received by the Secretary of Defense and the secretary has issued
   implementation guidance."^[163] Joe Biden later reversed Trump's policy
   when he became president in 2021.^[164]^[165]

   community in India (made up of Hijras and others) has a long history in
   India and in Hindu mythology.^[169]^[170] Justice KS Radhakrishnan
   noted in his decision that, "Seldom, our society realizes or cares to
   realize the trauma, agony and pain which the members of Transgender
   community undergo, nor appreciates the innate feelings of the members
   of the Transgender community, especially of those whose mind and body
   disown their biological sex".^[171] Hijras have faced structural
   discrimination including not being able to obtain driving licenses, and
   being prohibited from accessing various social benefits. It is also
   common for them to be banished from communities.^[172]

   Despite the distinction between sexual orientation and gender,
   throughout history gay, lesbian and bisexual subcultures were often the
   only places where gender-variant people were socially accepted in the
   gender role they felt they belonged to; especially during the time when
   legal or medical transitioning was almost impossible. This acceptance
   has had a complex history. Like the wider world, the gay community in
   Western societies did not generally distinguish between sex and gender
   identity until the 1970s, and the role of the transgender community in
   the history of LGBT rights is often overlooked.^[173]

   According to a study done at University of California, Los Angeles in
   2011, conducted in part by Gary J. Gates, 3.5% of adults across the
   United States identify as either gay, lesbian, or bisexuals whereas
   only 0.3% of adults identify as transgender.^[174] Transgender
   individuals have been part of various LGBT movements throughout
   history, with significant contributions dating back to the early days
   of the gay liberation movement.^[175]

   The LGBT community is not a monolithic group, and there are different
   modes of thought on who is a part of this diverse community. The
   changes that came with the Gay Liberation Movement and Civil Rights
   movement saw many gay, lesbian, and bisexual people making headway
   within the public sphere, and gaining support from the wider public,
   throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. The trans
   community only experienced a similar surge in activism during the start
   of the twenty-first century.^[176]^[175] Due to the many different
   groups that make up the broader LGBT movement, there are those within
   the larger community who do not believe that the trans community has a
   place within the LGBT space.^[176]^[177]

  Religion

   Main article: Transgender people and religion

   The Vatican’s doctrine department has issued a recent ruling that
   allows Catholic baptism for transgender individuals and infants born to
   same-sex couples. Dated October 31, 2024, these new regulations stem
   from questions submitted by Brazilian bishop Giuseppe Negri to the
   dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF). The responses,
   addressing specific sacraments, were published on the Vatican’s website
   in Italy. Concerning transgender individuals, the document states that
   they can undergo baptism like any other adult, as long as there is no
   potential for causing scandal or disorientation among other Catholics.

   If children identifying as transgender are adequately prepared and
   willing, they can receive baptism, according to the document.
   Additionally, it mentions that transgender individuals, including those
   who have undergone gender reassignment, can serve as godparents and
   witnesses in Catholic weddings under appropriate conditions. The
   document also allows the baptism of children from same-sex couples,
   provided there is a well-founded hope that they will receive Catholic
   religious education. The document emphasizes that individuals in
   same-sex relationships are regarded as committing a sin, and baptism is
   conditional upon repentance for such actions. Several sermons by Pope
   Francis are referenced in the document to support this ruling.^[178]

   The Church of England passed a motion at the 2017 General Synod, which
   would ensure Anglican churches accepted transgender people, even
   suggesting on their website that transgender people could be gifted a
   Bible with their new name inscribed to support them.^[179]

  Feminism

   Main articles: Feminist views on transgender topics and Transfeminism

   Feminist views on transgender women have changed over time, but have
   generally become more positive. Second-wave feminism saw numerous
   clashes opposed to transgender women, since they were not seen as
   "true" women, and as invading women-only spaces.^[180]^[181] Though
   second-wave feminism argued for the sex and gender distinction, some
   feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity
   and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female
   transition abandoned or devalued female identity and that transgender
   people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes.^[182] By the
   emergence of third-wave feminism (around 1990), opinions had shifted to
   being more inclusive of both trans and gay identities.^[183]^[184]
   Fourth-wave feminism (starting around 2012) has been widely
   trans-inclusive, but trans-exclusive groups and ideas remain as a
   minority, though one that is especially prominent in the
   UK.^[185]^[183]^[186] Feminists who do not accept that trans women are
   women have been labeled "trans-exclusionary radical feminists" (TERFs)
   or gender-critical feminists by opponents.^[187]^[188]

  Discrimination and support

   See also: Transphobia

   Transgender individuals experience significant rates of employment
   discrimination. Approximately 90% of trans people have encountered some
   form of harassment or mistreatment in their workplace. Moreover, 47%
   have experienced some form of adverse employment outcome due to being
   transgender; of this figure, 44% were passed over for a job, 23% were
   denied a promotion, and 26% were terminated on the grounds that they
   were transgender.^[189]

   Studies in several cultures have found that cisgender women are more
   likely to be accepting of trans people than cisgender
   men.^[190]^[191]^[192]^[193]

   The start of the twenty-first century saw the rise in transgender
   activism and with it an increase in support.^[175] Within the United
   States, groups such as the Trevor Project have been serving the wider
   LGBT community including people who identify with the term transgender.
   The group offers support in the form of educational resources including
   research, advocacy, and crisis services.^[194] The American Civil
   Liberties Unions (ACLU) is another group that fights legal battles in
   support of many different groups including those in the trans
   community.^[195]

   Other groups within the United States specifically advocate for
   transgender rights. One of these groups directly related to transgender
   support is the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE), which
   is committed to advocating for policy changes that protect transgender
   people and promote equality. Through their research, education, and
   advocacy efforts, the NCTE works to address issues such as healthcare
   access, employment discrimination, and legal recognition for
   transgender individuals.^[196] One prominent organization within Europe
   is Transgender Europe (TGEU), a network of organizations and
   individuals committed to promoting equality and human rights for
   transgender people within European borders. TGEU works to challenge
   discrimination, improve transgender healthcare access, advocate for
   legal recognition of gender identity, and support the well-being of
   transgender communities.^[197]

Population figures and prevalence

   See also: Transsexual § Prevalence

   Little is known about the prevalence of transgender people in the
   general population and reported prevalence estimates are greatly
   affected by variable definitions of transgender.^[198] According to a
   recent systematic review, an estimated 9.2 out of every 100,000 people
   have received or requested gender affirmation surgery or transgender
   hormone therapy; 6.8 out of every 100,000 people have received a
   transgender-specific diagnoses; and 355 out of every 100,000 people
   self-identify as transgender.^[198] These findings underscore the value
   of using consistent terminology related to studying the experience of
   transgender, as studies that explore surgical or hormonal gender
   affirmation therapy may or may not be connected with others that follow
   a diagnosis of "transsexualism", "gender identity disorder", or "gender
   dysphoria", none of which may relate with those that assess
   self-reported identity.^[198] Common terminology across studies does
   not yet exist, so population numbers may be inconsistent, depending on
   how they are being counted.

   A study in 2020 found that, since 1990, of those seeking sex hormone
   therapy for gender dysphoria there has been a steady increase in the
   percentage of trans men, such that they equal the number of trans women
   seeking this treatment.^[199]

  Asia

   [170px-Nongthoomfairtex.jpg] Nong Tum, a Kathoey internationally
   recognized for her portrayal in the film Beautiful Boxer

   In Thailand and Laos,^[200] the term kathoey is used to refer to
   male-to-female transgender people^[201] and effeminate gay men.^[202]
   However, many transgender people in Thailand do not identify as
   kathoey.^[203] Transgender people have also been documented in
   Iran,^[204] Japan,^[205] Nepal,^[206] Indonesia,^[207] Vietnam,^[208]
   South Korea,^[209] Jordan,^[210] Singapore,^[211] and the greater
   Chinese region, including Hong Kong,^[212]^[213] Taiwan,^[214] and the
   People's Republic of China.^[215]^[216]

   The cultures of the Indian subcontinent include a third gender,
   referred to as hijra in Hindi. In India, the Supreme Court on April 15,
   2014, recognized a third gender that is neither male nor female,
   stating "Recognition of transgenders as a third gender is not a social
   or medical issue but a human rights issue."^[217] In 1998, Shabnam
   Mausi became the first transgender person to be elected in India, in
   the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.^[218]

  Europe

   According to Amnesty International, 1.5 million transgender people live
   in the European Union (as at 2017), making up 0.3% of the
   population.^[219] A 2011 survey conducted by the Equality and Human
   Rights Commission in the UK found that of 10,026 respondents, 1.4%
   would be classified into a gender minority group. The survey also
   showed that 1% had gone through any part of a gender reassignment
   process (including thoughts or actions).^[220] In the England and Wales
   section of the 2021 United Kingdom census, 0.5% of respondents aged 16
   and over indicated that their gender identity was different from their
   sex assigned at birth.^[221]

  North America

   The 2021 Canadian census released by Statistics Canada found that
   59,460 Canadians (0.19% of the population) identified as
   transgender.^[222] According to the Survey of Safety in Public and
   Private Spaces by Statistics Canada in 2018, 0.24% of the Canadian
   population identified as transgender men, women or non-binary
   individuals.^[223]

   The Social Security Administration has tracked the sex of United States
   citizens since 1936.^[224] A 1968 estimate, by Ira B. Pauly, estimated
   that about 2,500 transsexual people were living in the United States,
   with four times as many trans women as trans men.^[225] One effort to
   quantify the modern population in 2011 gave a "rough estimate" that
   0.3% of adults in the US are transgender.^[226]^[227] More recent
   studies released in 2016 estimate the proportion of Americans who
   identify as transgender at 0.5 to 0.6%. This would put the total number
   of transgender Americans at approximately 1.4 million adults (as of
   2016^[update]).^[228]^[229]^[230]^[231]

   In the United States and Canada, some Native American and First Nations
   cultures traditionally recognize the existence of more than two
   genders,^[232] such as the Zuni male-bodied lhamana,^[233] the Lakota
   male-bodied winkte,^[234] and the Mohave male-bodied alyhaa and
   female-bodied hwamee.^[235] These traditional people, along with those
   from other North American Indigenous cultures, are sometimes part of
   the contemporary, pan-Indian two-spirit community.^[234] Historically,
   in most cultures who have alternate gender roles, if the spouse of a
   third gender person is not otherwise gender variant, they have not
   generally been regarded as other-gendered themselves, simply for being
   in a same-sex relationship.^[235] In Mexico, the Zapotec culture
   includes a third gender in the form of the Muxe.^[236] Mahu is a
   traditional third gender in Hawai'i and Tahiti. Mahu are valued as
   teachers, caretakers of culture, and healers, such as Kapaemahu. Diné
   (Navajo) have Nádleehi.^[112]

  Latin America

   In Latin American cultures, a travesti is an individual who has been
   assigned male at birth and who has a feminine, transfeminine, or
   "femme" gender identity. Travestis generally undergo hormonal
   treatment, use female gender expression including new names and
   pronouns from the masculine ones they were given when assigned a sex,
   and might use breast implants, but they are not offered or do not
   desire sex-reassignment surgery. Travesti might be regarded as a gender
   in itself (a "third gender"), a mix between man and woman
   ("intergender/androgynes"), or the presence of both masculine and
   feminine identities in a single person ("bigender"). They are framed as
   something entirely separate from transgender women, who possess the
   same gender identity of people assigned female at birth.^[237]

   Other transgender identities are becoming more widely known, as a
   result of contact with other cultures of the Western world.^[238] These
   newer identities, sometimes known under the umbrella use of the term
   "genderqueer",^[238] along with the older travesti term, are known as
   non-binary and go along with binary transgender identities (those
   traditionally diagnosed under the obsolete label of "transsexualism")
   under the single umbrella of transgender, but are distinguished from
   cross-dressers and drag queens and kings, that are held as
   nonconforming gender expressions rather than transgender gender
   identities when a distinction is made.^[239]

Culture

  Coming out

   Main article: Coming out

   Transgender people vary greatly in choosing when, whether, and how to
   disclose their transgender status to family, close friends, and others.
   The prevalence of discrimination and violence against transgender
   persons can make coming out a risky decision. Fear of retaliatory
   behavior, such as being removed from the parental home while underage,
   is a cause for transgender people to not come out to their families
   until they have reached adulthood.^[citation needed] Parental confusion
   and lack of acceptance of a transgender child may result in parents
   treating a newly revealed gender identity as a "phase" or making
   efforts to change their children back to "normal" by utilizing mental
   health services to alter the child's gender
   identity.^[240]^[better source needed]

   The internet can play a significant role in the coming out process for
   transgender people. Some come out in an online identity first,
   providing an opportunity to go through experiences virtually and safely
   before risking social sanctions in the real world.^[241]

  Visibility

   In 2014, the United States reached a "transgender tipping point",
   according to Time.^[242]^[243] At this time, the media visibility of
   transgender people reached a level higher than seen before. Since then,
   the number of transgender portrayals across TV platforms has stayed
   elevated.^[244]
   [220px-Existrans_2017_%2837146607344%29.jpg] Trans March "Existrans"
   2017

   Annual marches, protests or gatherings take place around the world for
   transgender issues, often taking place during the time of local Pride
   parades for LGBT people. These events are frequently organised by trans
   communities to build community, address human rights struggles, and
   create visibility.^[245]^[246]^[247]^[248] International Transgender
   Day of Visibility is an annual holiday occurring on March
   31^[249]^[250] dedicated to celebrating transgender people and raising
   awareness of discrimination faced by transgender people worldwide. The
   holiday was founded by Michigan-based transgender activist^[251] Rachel
   Crandall in 2009.^[252]

   Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) is held every year on November 20
   in honor of Rita Hester, who was killed on November 28, 1998. Her
   murder remains unsolved, but was described in 2022 as "a result of
   transphobia and anti-trans violence" by the Office of the Mayor of
   Boston, Michelle Wu.^[253] TDOR memorializes victims of hate crimes and
   prejudice and raises awareness of hate crimes committed upon living
   transgender people.^[254] Transgender Awareness Week is a one-week
   celebration leading up to TDOR, dedicated to educating about
   transgender and gender non-conforming people and the issues associated
   with their transition or identity.^[255]

  Pride symbols

   See also: Transgender flag and Gendered associations of pink and blue

   A common symbol for the transgender community is the Transgender Pride
   Flag, which was designed by the American transgender woman Monica Helms
   in 1999, and was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona, in
   2000. The flag consists of five horizontal stripes: light blue, pink,
   white, pink, and light blue^[256] Other transgender symbols include the
   butterfly (symbolizing transformation or metamorphosis),^[257] and a
   pink/light blue yin and yang symbol.^[258] Several gender symbols have
   been used to represent transgender people, including ⚥ and
   ⚧.^[259]^[260]

   sexual activity. (Liberman, Mark. "Single-X Education". Language Log.

       John Oliven (1965) and was popularized by various transgender

       John F. Oliven's 1965 book, "Sexual Hygiene and Pathology." Oliven
       writes:
       Where the compulsive urge reaches beyond female vestments, and
       becomes an urge for gender ('sex') change, transvestism becomes
       'transsexualism.' The term is misleading; actually,
       'transgenderism' is what is meant, because sexuality is not a major
       factor in primary transvestism.
       Although Oliven's understanding of "transgender"is not the same as
       our understanding of it today, his use of it is still significant.
       As K.J. Rawson and Cristan Williams note in their book,
       "Transgender*: The Rhetorical Landscape of a Term," Oliven didn't
       use the word in the book's 1955 edition; it was added later, when
       the second edition was revised and published.
       Gradually, some members of this marginalized community began to
       apply the word "transgender"to themselves. For example, Virginia
       Charles Prince, publisher of the long-running periodical
       "Transvestia," occasionally used a variation of the word,
       "transgenderal.""

       Archive, at the University of Ulster, in 1986 (Ekins, 1988). The
       term was chosen to provide an umbrella concept which avoided such
       medical categories as transsexual and transvestite; which included
       the widest possible range of transgender phenomena; and which took
       the sociological view that aspects of sex, sexuality and gender
       (not just gender), including the binary divide, all have socially
       constructed components. Not long afterwards, the 'transgender
       community' came to be used as an umbrella term to include
       transsexuals, transvestites, transgenderists, drag queens, and so
       on, as well as (in some uses) to include their partners and friends
       and professional service providers."
