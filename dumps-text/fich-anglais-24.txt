   The rights of transgender people - and whether they affect the rights
   of women - are often in the spotlight.

   It's led to legal disputes, protests and discussions about education
   and free speech.

What does transgender mean?

   Gender identity is a term used by some to describe someone's sense of
   their gender.

   A transgender person's gender identity is not the same as the sex
   recorded on their original birth certificate.

   A transgender man is someone registered female at birth, but who
   identifies as a man.

   A transgender woman is someone registered male at birth, but who
   identifies as a woman.

   You might hear other terms:
     * Trans is a shorter way of saying transgender
     * Gender dysphoria describes the "unease or dissatisfaction" some
       people feel about the difference between their biological sex and
       gender identity
     * Some people who do not consider themselves to have a solely male or
       female gender identity describe themselves as non-binary

   Our sex is recorded as male or female at birth, based on physical
   characteristics. Some people are born with chromosomal or other
   physical differences that can make this a complex judgement.

   They are sometimes referred to as intersex, or having differences of
   sexual development (DSD).

How many transgender people are there in the UK?

   In the England and Wales census, 262,000 people aged 16 and over said
   their gender identity was different to their birth sex.

   Some academics raised concerns that the question may not have been
   understood and could be an overestimate. The Office for National
   Statistics said it was confident the results were processed accurately,
   but is reviewing the data.

   A 2018 estimate by the government suggested there could be between
   200,000 and 500,000 people who identify as transgender across the UK.

What changes can transgender people make?

   Many transgender people live according to their gender identity -
   including how they dress, and their chosen name and pronouns.

   Some may take hormone medication, or have surgery.

   People can also apply to alter their birth certificate, passport and
   driving licence.

   These social, physical and legal changes are known as transitioning.

   Under the Gender Recognition Act 2004, UK adults can change their legal
   sex if they meet certain criteria.

   This means their acquired gender can be recorded on their birth,
   marriage and death certificates.

   The main requirements include:
     * A medical report of a gender dysphoria diagnosis
     * Evidence of living full time in their acquired gender for at least
       two years
     * A declaration that they will live permanently in their acquired
       gender
     * They must be 18 or over and pay a Â£5 fee

   In the UK, non-binary is not recognised as a gender on legal documents
   including birth certificates and passports.

   About 7,000 gender recognition certificates have been issued in
   England, Wales and Scotland.

   In 2018 the UK government began considering changes to the law in
   England and Wales, which it said would aim to make it easier for
   transgender people to change their legal gender on birth certificates.

   It decided not to go ahead with some of the proposed changes, but did
   move the application process online and lowered the cost of a
   certificate.

   In 2022, Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) voted to remove the
   need for a medical diagnosis and lower the application age to 16.

   However, the UK government blocked this from becoming law. Ministers
   said the draft law would conflict with equality protections applying
   across the whole of Great Britain.

   The Scottish government is challenging this decision in the courts.

What does this mean for women's spaces?

   There has been debate about how to balance the rights of different
   groups within society.

   Much of this has focused on access to women-only spaces such as
   toilets, domestic abuse refuges and prisons.

   There has also been controversy about the participation of trans women
   in female-only categories in sports.

   Transgender people may wish to use services and facilities which align
   with their gender identity, whereas other groups say that these should
   be separated by birth sex.

   The Equality Act 2010 identifies a number of groups with protected
   characteristics - including gender reassignment and sex - and protects
   those groups from discrimination.

   But single-sex service providers can exclude transgender people where
   this is a ''proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim'', such
   as privacy or safety.

   However, some say the law is not clearly understood and women's
   sex-based rights are under threat.

   The Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that amending the
   Equality Act definition of "sex" to "biological sex" is worth further
   consideration. It would make it simpler for certain spaces to be
   single-sex, regardless of whether a person has a Gender Recognition
   Certificate.

   The UK government is considering the advice.

Gender identity and children

   There has been an increase in the number of children referred to the
   under-18s Gender Identity and Development Service (Gids) in England and
   Wales, especially among patients registered female at birth.

   NHS England says there were more than 5,000 referrals in 2021-2022,
   compared with 250 referrals in 2011-12.

   In some cases, young patients have been prescribed puberty blockers.
   These delay the onset of puberty, but the NHS says little is known
   about their long term side effects.

   An independent review said the current service is "unsustainable" and
   that many children referred to Gids have complex needs. It said these
   can sometimes be overlooked once they are diagnosed with gender
   dysphoria and called for a "fundamentally different" model of care for
   children.

   Following the review, the NHS decided puberty blockers should only be
   given to children and adolescents as part of clinical research.

   NHS England announced Gids will close in March 2024 and regional
   clinics working alongside children's hospitals will open.

   Young people in Scotland can get a GP referral or refer themselves to
   the gender service at the Sandyford Clinic.

   Those in Northern Ireland who want to talk to a specialist about their
   gender identity can use the Knowing Our Identity service.

   In Wales, children or teenagers thought to have gender dysphoria will
   usually be referred to a specialist child and adolescent Gender
   Identity Clinic.
