Welcome to Transgender Trend.

Listen here to Founder and Director Stephanie Davies-Arai talking about the
harms of gender ideology for children and young people.

With thanks to FiLiA charity for this recording.

   “We have failed this generation of kids”.
   Stephanie Davies-Arai talks to Benjamin Boyce about the new unreality
   we are living in, what we are doing to kids, the real function of
   puberty blockers and how The Tavistock Judicial Review has changed the
   world.

   Transgender Trend is the leading organisation in the call for
   evidence-based healthcare for children and young people suffering
   gender dysphoria and for factual, science-based teaching in schools.
   Our expertise was acknowledged recently when we were granted permission
   by the High Court to intervene in the Keira Bell v Tavistock & Portman
   NHS Trust judicial review.

   Established in 2015, Transgender Trend has led the way in advocating
   for the rights of children to reject gender stereotypes and be who they
   really are without discrimination, labelling or medical intervention to
   ‘fix’ them.

   We believe all children have the right to go through puberty and reach
   adulthood with their fertility intact and that this is a fundamental
   human right.

   We believe that children with gender dysphoria deserve evidence-based
   treatment and have a right to the same duty of care as any other child.

   Our message is:

No child is born in the wrong body.

   Transgender Trend advocates for the most vulnerable children who are
   caught up in the recent trend in society to replace the objective
   reality of sex with the subjective idea of ‘gender identity’ as the
   criteria for being a man or being a woman. ‘Gender identity’ ideology
   teaches children who don’t conform to masculine or feminine stereotypes
   that their personalities are ‘wrong’ for their sex, and their bodies
   are then ‘wrong’ for their gender identity.

   The number of children and young people who now believe they are really
   the opposite sex is reflected in the unprecedented recent trend in
   referrals to the Tavistock Gender Identity Development Service.

   Tavistock referrals

   Boys and girls should be able to wear what they like and have whatever
   interests they choose without adult interpretation through the lens of
   a non-scientific, ideological belief that human beings are born with an
   innate sense of being male or female, which is inevitably based on sex
   stereotypes.

   In school, acceptance of a boy who likes to play with dolls as a girl
   is no acceptance at all.

   Acceptance of a lesbian adolescent girl as a straight boy is no
   acceptance at all.

   This approach only serves to reinforce restrictive and harmful
   stereotypes. ‘Affirmation’ is not kind, it affirms to a child that they
   are the wrong sex and encourages a child’s belief that their body needs
   medically changing. Medical intervention can only ever effect cosmetic
   change; the child’s sex remains the same.

   We advocate for the rights of lesbian and gay young people to grow up
   as lesbian or gay. We advocate for the rights of autistic children and
   those with mental health problems or background trauma to receive
   proper therapeutic care, not a ‘diagnosis’ that they are really the
   opposite sex. All children and young people deserve treatment based on
   clinical evidence, not ideology.

   In schools all children deserve to be taught science-based facts, not
   ideology disguised as ‘fact’. All children have the right to privacy
   from the opposite sex in toilets and changing-rooms. Policy in schools
   must always put safeguarding first and schools should not use resources
   that confuse children about sex.

   Children should not be coerced into expressing a belief in ‘gender
   identity’ through the threat that not to do so is ‘unkind’ or
   ‘transphobic’.
