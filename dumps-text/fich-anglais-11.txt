Transgender

   Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff

   People whose gender identity or expression does not conform to the sex
   they were assigned at birth are transgender. While individuals may be
   assigned to a sex at birth based on how they present biologically,
   their sense of their gender may differ. A trans man is a man who was
   identified as female at birth, and a trans woman is a woman who was
   identified as male. (Transsexual is an older term that referred to
   trans individuals who sought or undertook intervention to change their
   bodies.)

   Many trans people, but not all, take steps, either through surgery,
   hormone treatments, or cosmetic or fashion decisions, to make their
   bodies and appearances align with their gender identities—the gender
   with which they identify—whether male-to-female or female-to-male.
   These steps, which also may include changing one’s name and/or
   pronouns, are often referred to as transitioning, or as gender
   affirmation, although the term gender reassignment is used by some.
   (Cross-dressers, distinct from transgender individuals, generally
   identify with the gender label they receive at birth but often wear
   clothing associated with a different gender.)

   Gender has increasingly come to be recognized as existing on a
   continuum. Some people whose self-concept falls outside the traditional
   binary constructs of male and female, for example, identify as
   genderqueer. Others living outside of these binary constructs may
   identify as nonbinary, gender-nonconforming or third gender. These
   individuals may or may not also identify as transgender.

   The Transgender Experience

   Any person who identifies differently from the gender they were
   assigned at birth is transgender. There is no single source of
   transgender identity. Biological and genetic factors may play a role
   before a person is born, but personal experiences, in childhood,
   adolescence, or beyond, may also contribute to one’s gender identity,
   or at least to one’s awareness of it and comfort disclosing it.

   The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates that there
   are 1.4 million adults in the U.S. who identify as transgender,
   representing 0.7 percent of people between ages 18 and 24 and 0.5
   percent of those older than 65. Other experts believe the actual number
   of trans Americans may be closer to 2 million. The Williams Institute
   also estimates that 150,000 U.S. residents between ages 13 and 17 are
   transgender.
   What is gender dysphoria?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Beginning as early as childhood, a transgender person may have
   feelings of disconnection between their primary and secondary sex
   traits and designated gender and the gender with which they identify.
   People who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence,
   according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
   (DSM-5), may receive a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. It’s a diagnosis
   that has been widely debated in the psychological and transgender
   communities because many see it as unnecessarily pathologizing of trans
   people, although getting a diagnosis can help some individuals access
   mental health care, and insurance coverage, they might otherwise not be
   able to take advantage of.

   While some children who experience such feelings do not go on to
   identify as transgender in adulthood, long-standing gender dysphoria is
   a common experience among adults who do identify as transgender.

   For more, see Gender Dysphoria.


   Does a person have to transition their gender to be transgender?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   No, but many do. Transitioning, or gender affirmation, is a complex
   process, one that begins not with medical procedures but with
   expressing one's identity, to themselves and to others with whom they
   feel safe. Reaching out to transgender community groups, or meeting
   with a mental health professional who provides affirmative care for
   transgender people are often among the first steps in the process.

   Different individuals follow different paths to gender affirmation:
   Some may change their name or pronouns, and/or change their clothing or
   appearance in nonmedical ways, while others will seek hormone therapy
   treatments and surgical procedures, often at significant expense, that
   modify their body to conform with their gender identity.
   Are trans people also homosexual?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   They may be. An individual’s gender or gender identity does not
   determine their sexual orientation. Trans people, like any other
   individuals, may be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, or
   none of the above. Trans people commonly refer to their sexual
   orientation in terms of their gender identity: For example, a trans
   woman attracted to women would most likely consider herself to be a
   lesbian or gay woman.
   Do trans people date heterosexual nontrans partners?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   They can, but they often don’t, in part because of persistent
   transphobia and resistance to such pairings among the heterosexual,
   cisgender population. For example, in one recent study, less than 3
   percent of heterosexual cisgender people said they would consider
   dating a trans individual, while 12 percent of nontransgender gay men,
   29 percent of nontransgender lesbians, and slightly more than half of
   people who identified as bisexual, queer, or nonbinary, reported that
   they would.
   Is being transgender a mental health disorder?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   No. Despite past misconceptions and persistent myths, being trans is
   not a mental health disorder. Mental health conditions by definition
   cause individuals significant distress or disability, while for trans
   people, affirmation of their identity is often a source of relief.
   However, many people struggling with expressing their gender identity,
   or facing discrimination, rejection, obstacles, or abuse because of it,
   may become depressed or anxious, or experience suicidal ideation. It is
   important that they seek out therapy or treatment from a mental health
   professional.
   What social and political challenges do trans people face?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Transgender awareness has grown in recent years, especially as more
   trans people have become prominent in pop culture and as more young
   people speak out about their identities at earlier ages than trans
   people in earlier generations may have. According to one survey, 62
   percent of adults in the U.S. now say they support trans rights, as
   opposed to 29 percent just five years earlier. Today, 30 percent of
   Americans say they personally know a trans person. But trans
   individuals still face significant social bias, stigma, abuse,
   violence, and legal discrimination, as well as a lingering perception
   based on outdated myths that they are mentally ill, socially deviant,
   or sexually predatory.

   Hate crimes have been frequently perpetuated against members of the
   transgender community. A majority of trans people report having
   experienced intimate partner violence, and nearly half report having
   been sexually assaulted, according to research by advocacy group Human
   Rights Campaign. Nearly 1 in 10 trans individuals report being
   physically assaulted each year, and dozens have been violently killed
   in the U.S. in recent years. Trans people are more likely to live in
   poverty and without health care than others, in part due to bias that
   limits their opportunities in the workforce. And trans individuals of
   racial or ethnic minority backgrounds generally report higher levels of
   discrimination of all kinds.

   In some states, legislatures have supported laws barring trans people
   from using public bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity
   or competing in athletic competition against those who share their
   gender identity. Many anti-discrimination statutes are not written, or
   have not been updated, to legally protect the civil rights of trans
   people, although more communities are passing laws or taking other
   legal actions to affirm the rights or trans individuals.
   How can I support trans individuals in my family, office, or community?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Use names and pronouns that fit their stated preference and gender. Do
   not make assumptions, such as about their sexual orientation or that
   they must be pursuing hormonal or surgical treatments. Learn about
   trans identity from books, organizations, or trusted websites, and ask
   questions of a friend or loved on with an open mind. If you are
   struggling with your own feelings about a partner, parent, child, or
   close friend expressing a different gender identity, don’t feel ashamed
   or guilty about it, but do seek support from a mental health
   professional to help you take steps to maintain your strong
   relationship.

   The Lives of Transgender Youth

   For many adolescents and young adults, the journey to confidently
   declaring their gender identity and beginning to live as the gender
   that suits them ends in positivity, greater self-confidence, and higher
   self-esteem. But the path to that point often involves intense mental
   and emotional stress. Questioning one’s own identity, and reckoning
   with the ramifications of the conclusions, can upend one’s previous
   beliefs, and re-entering life as a different gender may lead to a loss
   of friendships and the jeopardizing of family connections, as well as
   bullying and discrimination, often violent, at school and in the
   community.

   Research suggests that as many as two-thirds of transgender adolescents
   have had suicidal thoughts, as compared to 13 percent of other teens.
   But the presence of supportive others in a young transgender person’s
   life, especially parents, can make a significant difference: For
   example, 64 percent of transgender teens who felt supported by parents
   reported having high self-esteem, as opposed to just 13 percent of
   those who did not.
   How do people come to understand that they are transgender?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   People can become aware of their transgender identity at any age. Some
   become conscious of their identity as young children, and many who
   become aware of it in adolescence or adulthood can look back at early
   experiences of not feeling that they fit in with others from the gender
   to which they were assigned at birth.

   Many transgender individuals experience not just a sense of discomfort
   but intense dissatisfaction with their assigned sex or sexual
   characteristics, or the roles they are expected to play as presumed
   members of one gender or another. These feelings of gender dissonance
   can lead to depression and even suicidal ideation without an outlet to
   share them or support from family or friends. Some quickly and readily
   embrace their trans identity; others may not find such gender resonance
   until they encounter others who have had the same experience and with
   whom they can identify. But at any age, trans people may struggle with
   their identities, and may experience confusion, shame, or guilt,
   especially if their family, peer group, or community is not supportive
   of identities along the gender spectrum.
   How can a parent support a gender non-conforming child?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   By not rejecting them or dismissing their statements, but by being
   affirming and becoming their ally and advocate, in the family, in their
   school, and if necessary, in the broader community. Some children may
   appear to be gender non-conforming from an early age, and may
   experience distress or anxiety about their identity or the expectations
   placed on them because of what others assume to be their gender; their
   interactions with peers may be especially stressful.

   Parents should not assume, or insist, that these feelings merely
   represent a “phase,” nor should they encourage or force a child to
   conform to a gender role that nay not fit their identity. Learning as
   much as they can about the trans experience, including reading about
   the experiences of other parents, can be helpful.
   How can a parent support a transitioning child?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   By standing with them through their disclosures, medical decisions, and
   appointments, and by taking everyday steps like using their child’s
   chosen pronoun, or working with them to choose a new name.
   Transitioning at a young age may involve harrowing decisions which
   generally require parental consent, such as considering whether to take
   medication to block or delay puberty. Becoming informed about the
   ramifications of such medical decisions, and discussing them openly
   with a child and their doctor, can help to lessen a young person’s
   anxiety.
   What is “rapid-onset” gender dysphoria?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   “Rapid-onset” gender dysphoria is a discredited term used by some to
   describe the apparent phenomenon of young people declaring themselves
   to be transgender all of a sudden, suggesting that these individuals
   have been influenced by social media, popular culture, or even peer
   pressure. The term has been used by some to explain the increased
   numbers of transgender youth in recent years, particularly in
   communities where the numbers seem to be unexpectedly high.

   However, the 2018 paper on which this theory is based has been widely
   debunked for, among other reasons, the fact that its survey
   participants were parents who already believed that their children had
   changed their gender identity with no previous warning. No actual trans
   youth were studied to formulate the paper’s conclusions. While the
   theory has gained traction in some circles and continues to be used to
   question the sincerity of some transgender youth, the journal that
   published the paper has published a correction, stating, “Rapid-onset
   gender dysphoria is not a formal mental health diagnosis at this time.
   This report did not collect data from the adolescents and young adults
   (AYAs) or clinicians and therefore does not validate the phenomenon."
