   TORVAIANICA, Italy/VATICAN CITY, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The run-down beach
   town of Torvaianica is about 35 kms (20 miles) south of the Vatican.

   But for transgender women who live there it had seemed light years away
   until a rapprochement with the Catholic Church that began during the
   COVID-19 lockdown and led to an invitation to have lunch with Pope
   Francis on Sunday.

   Claudia Victoria Salas, 55, and Carla Segovia, 46, both Argentinian,
   were in a group of transgender people, among about 1,200 poor and
   homeless people, who attended the lunch on the Church's World Day of
   the poor.

   To her surprise, Salas, a former sex worker, found herself seated
   opposite the pope, who is also Argentinian, at the main table in the
   auditorium, where the pontiff holds his general audiences in winter.

   "We transgenders here in Italy feel a bit more human because the fact
   that Pope Francis brings us closer to the Church is a beautiful thing,"
   Carla Segovia, 46, a sex worker, said earlier this week on the deserted
   windy beach of Torvaianica.

   "Because we need some love," she said.

   Last week, the Vatican's doctrinal office issued a statement saying
   transgender people can be godparents at Roman Catholic baptisms,
   witnesses at religious weddings and receive baptism themselves.

   LGBT rights advocates in the church welcomed the move while
   conservatives condemned it, accusing Francis of sending confusing
   signals about sexual morality to the faithful.

   Francis, 86, has tried to make the Church more welcoming to the LGBT
   community without changing Church teachings, including one saying that
   same-sex attraction is not sinful but same-sex acts are.

   At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Father Andrea Conocchia, the
   pastor of the Blessed Immaculate Virgin parish in Torvaianica helped
   the transgender community with food and other assistance.

   Parish resources were stretched at the time because many people were
   cut off from income, so Conocchia asked for help from the cardinal who
   runs the pope's charities.

   As well as sending money, the cardinal arranged for them to have COVID
   vaccinations in the Vatican and to meet the pope.

   "For us, he is our saint," Salas said of Conocchia last week.

   On Sunday, Conocchia arrived at the Vatican on a bus with about 50 poor
   from his parish, including transgender people, both foreign born and
   Italian.

   "This is a fantastic opportunity for all of us transsexuals," Segovia
   said, as she entered the auditorium. "I send the pope a big kiss".
