   transgender, term self-applied by persons whose gender identity varies
   from that traditionally associated with their apparent biological sex
   at birth. In its original and narrower sense, transgender referred to
   males and females who respectively gender-identify as females and
   males. In a later and broader sense, it has come to designate persons
   whose gender identities incorporate behaviours and traits traditionally
   associated with the opposite sex. Transgender persons may thus include
   transsexuals, transgenderists (in one usage of the term, persons who
   gender-identify with the opposite sex but who choose not to undergo
   sex-reassignment surgery or hormone treatments), and androgynes
   (biologically or psychologically androgynous persons), among other
   groups. In its broader sense, transgender is closely related to the
   more-recent term genderqueer, which is self-applied by persons who are
   either transgender or who have no gender, a third (neither male nor
   female) gender, or a fluctuating gender.

   In part because there is no universally accepted definition of
   transgender (different researchers use the term in different ways), it
   is uncertain how many transgender persons there are. Estimates in the
   United States, based on the broad definition used in this article, have
   varied from less than 1 percent to more than 3 percent of the
   population in the early 21st century.

Sex, gender, and sexual orientation

   The notion of transgender presupposes fundamental distinctions between
   the concepts of sex, gender, and sexual orientation (see human sexual
   behaviour). Whereas sex is a biological category, gender refers to the
   set of traits and behaviours that are traditionally associated with a
   particular sex. A person who is transgender experiences and expresses a
   disjunction between sex and gender. Sexual orientation, in contrast, is
   defined in terms of the sexes or genders to which a person is sexually,
   emotionally, or romantically attracted. It is a widespread but mistaken
   assumption that transgender persons are necessarily homosexual (i.e.,
   attracted to members of the sex that they were assigned at birth).
   Although some are homosexual, others are heterosexual or bisexual or do
   not identify with any particular sexual orientation.

Theoretical background

   Various theories of gender have been proposed as explanations of the
   experience of transgender persons. In addition to the concepts of sex
   and gender, those of gender identity and gender expression are
   particularly important for such theories. Gender identity refers to a
   person’s self-identification as male or female or as something in
   between or outside of those categories. Gender expression refers to the
   behaviour through which one expresses one’s gender identity—e.g., by
   using certain pronouns or wearing certain kinds of clothing or having a
   particular hairstyle. Whereas gender identity is not something that
   others can view, gender expression is publicly visible.

   The main theories of gender are essentialism, social constructionism,
   and performativity. Essentialists place emphasis on biological
   characteristics, arguing that a person’s gender identity is fixed at
   birth, whether or not it corresponds to biological sex. Essentialism is
   thus opposed to the view that gender identity is entirely socially
   constructed—i.e., a product of social or societal influences. The
   central case in need of explanation, according to essentialists, is
   that of persons who report having always (for as long as they can
   remember) felt that they belonged to the sex opposite the one that they
   were assigned at birth. Such experiences are typical of transsexuals,
   who feel the need to change their sex to match the gender identity they
   feel they have always had.

   Social constructionism, as the term suggests, is the view that gender
   is socially constructed. That gender is socially constructed is shown,
   according to constructionists, by the fact that the traits and
   behaviours traditionally associated with the male or female sex have
   varied over time and across cultures, which would not be the case if
   gender were innate. It is important to note that essentialism and
   social constructivism, as those theories are defined in this article,
   are not necessarily inconsistent, insofar as they aim to explain
   different (though obviously related) things: the one concerns the
   supposed biological origin of gender identity (one’s
   self-identification as male or female), the other the supposed social
   or societal origin of gender (the traits and behaviours that make up
   the masculine or the feminine). It is entirely possible that the former
   is innate and the latter largely, if not entirely, learned, in the
   broad sense of being instilled.

   As to sex, some social constructivists claim that it too is not
   biologically given but rather pronounced by medical professionals whose
   role it is to place infants into one or the other category at birth. A
   prominent defender of that view is the American philosopher Judith
   Butler, who is also known as a developer of the performative theory of
   gender.

   An extension of social constructivism is the performative theory, or
   performativity, which holds that gender is a “performance” that people
   undertake on a daily basis, even if only unconsciously. In particular,
   gender is not the expression of an underlying essence or nature,
   whether based on sex or on gender identity. It is rather a series of
   acts whose constant repetition creates the illusion that an underlying
   nature exists. According to Butler, gender “is performatively
   constituted by the very ‘expressions’ that are said to be its results.”
