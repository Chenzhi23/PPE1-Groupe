COP28 and beyond: Five tips for gender-inclusive climate reporting
            Hectares of newsprint and hours of screentime are dedicated to
            COP28. It's little surprise as the calls for action on climate
            change and gender equality grow ever more urgent. So, how can
            journalists cut through the noise? How can they report
            smarter, share the best information faster and tell stories
            that have a lasting impact? "Good journalism is crucial for...

Gender Equality Index 2023: Towards a green transition in transport and
energy
            The Gender Equality Index 2023 presents the EU in relation to
            gender equality amid crises and uncertainties. In recent
            years, the world has been hit by repeated shocks and multiple
            crises. What remains constant is the fact that when crisis
            strikes, women and girls suffer disproportionally. The crises
            and shocks continuously threaten to create new challenges and
            reverse years of...

Gender-sensitive communication
            This toolkit provides guidelines for the use of
            gender-sensitive language in writing. Gender-sensitive
            communication ensures that women and men - and those who do
            not conform to the binary gender system - are treated as
            persons of equal importance and dignity.

for women's empowerment
            With International Women's Day just around the corner,
            progress towards gender equality is high on the agenda. But
            what does it take to really pave the way for gender equality?

GRPP: Four letters can unlock EUR2 trillion to accelerate our drive towards
gender equality
            Each year the EU spends 14% of its Gross Domestic Product
            (GDP) on public works, from building projects to social
            infrastructure. Smart targeting of that EUR2 trillion in
            public funds and considering how it impacts the lives of both
            women and men is the essence of Gender-responsive public
            procurement, or GRPP.
