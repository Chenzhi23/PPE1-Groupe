WELCOME!

   WELCOME!

   TransAmsterdam is a trans organization for art, culture, and lifestyle.
   Our goal is to increase the visibility of transgender, including
   non-binary, people and improve their image through art and culture. Are
   you an artist and do you want to share or develop your talents? Or
   would you like to meet other people in and surrounding the transgender
   community? Then TransAmsterdam is the organization for you!


   With art and culture, we aim to show that trans people are more than
   their gender. By doing so, we connect the trans community to the rest
   of society and increase the emancipation and empowerment of transgender
   people in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and beyond.


   To showcase trans people’s creativity, we work together with a diverse
   array of artists, such as photographers, actors, poets, musicians,
   writers, filmmakers, and painters. Besides that, we also collaborate
   with national and international art and cultural organizations. In
   2019, we founded the Trans Art School, where trans people can take part
   in art, cultural and lifestyle workshops.


   Interested? See which activities and events we have planned on our
   website and social media. ​​​Or would you like to collaborate with or
   volunteer for us? Then email us at info@transamsterdam.nl.


   WHAT DO WE OFER TO IMPROVE THE VISIBILITY AND IMAGE OF TRANSGENDER
   PEOPLE?

       people and trans artists


     * We organize workshops and themed meetings at our Trans Art School.

       cultural and other organizations and institutions.


     * We acquire funds and subsidies that contribute to the realization
       of our goal.
