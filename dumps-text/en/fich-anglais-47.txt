Glossary of Terms Related to Transgender Communities

   Main content start

   Terminology frequently morphs within LGBTQIA communities, and a word
   that means one thing in one community may mean something else in
   another community. The terms used here are commonly used in the
   Stanford LGBTQIA community.
   2023-24 Neighborhood Decorative Accent Line

Basic Definitions

     * Assigned Female At Birth (AFAB) or Female-Assigned-at-Birth (FAAB):
       An individual assigned female at birth.
     * Assigned Male At Birth (AMAB) or Male-Assigned-at-Birth (MAAB): An
       individual assigned male at birth.
     * Assigned Sex or Sex Assigned At Birth: The sex (typically M or F)
       that is assigned to a person based on external genitalia at birth.
     * Cisgender, Cis: Someone whose gender identity corresponds with
       expectations based on the sex they were assigned at birth. For
       example, a person who was assigned female at birth and identifies
       as a woman is regarded as cisgender or as a cisgender woman.
     * Gender-Affirming Surgery: Any surgical procedure that aims to
       increase a sense of congruence with one’s gender identity and
       physical body. Gender-affirming surgeries may include: chest
       reconstructive surgeries (e.g., double mastectomy, feminizing
       mammoplasty), genital reconstructive surgeries (e.g., orchiectomy,
       vaginoplasty, metoidioplasty, phalloplasty), facial feminization
       surgeries (e.g., tracheal shave, rhinoplasty, brow lift), or other
       procedures (e.g., vocal cord surgery). In California, surgery is
       not required to change one’s legal gender marker. Note: This term
       is preferred over the outdated term Sexual Reassignment Surgery
       (SRS). It is also preferred over the term gender confirmation
       surgery (GCS) because gender cannot be “confirmed” by having
       surgery. A person’s gender is to be respected regardless of
       surgical history/status or what kind of genitals they have or had.
       It is best to avoid terms such as “pre-op”, “non-op”, or “post-op,”
       as they reinforce the assumption all trans people want to or will
       have the opportunity to have surgery.
     * Gender Dysphoria: Emotional distress related to the sense that
       one’s assigned sex is not in line with one’s gender identity.
       Gender Dysphoria is also a medical and mental health diagnosis that
       may warrant treatment in the form of gender-affirming medical
       interventions.
     * Gender Expression: The ways in which a person outwardly expresses
       their gender, often through hair, makeup, clothing, and other
       aspects of appearance. Gender expression does not always correspond
       to gender identity.
     * Gender Identity: The inherent feeling within an individual of what
       gender they are; a person may identify as a man, woman, neither,
       in-between, both, or fluidly moving between these two binary
       categories.
     * Gender-Neutral Pronouns: Pronouns that a person may use when they
       do not fully identify with binary gender categories. Examples of
       gender-neutral pronouns include singular they/them/their,
       ey/em/eir, zie/hir/hirs, or no pronouns. It’s best to ask what
       pronouns are appropriate for them.
     * Genderqueer: A gender identity that denotes someone who does not
       fully identify with the binary genders of male/man/masculine or
       female/woman/feminine. A genderqueer person may identify as neither
       a man nor a woman, in-between, both, fluidly moving between these
       two categories, or as a third/alternate gender. Related to the
       term nonbinary, which has become more popular in the 2010’s.
     * Intersex: A general term used for a variety of conditions in which
       a person is born with a physical characteristics (e.g., gonads,
       chromosomal makeup, external genitalia, internal reproductive or
       urinary organs) that do not fit typical medical or social
       definitions of female or male. Some people use the term DSD
       (Disorders of Sex Development) to describe intersex people, but
       this is not seen as affirming by intersex communities.
     * Nonbinary: A gender identity that denotes someone who does not
       fully identify with the binary genders of male/man/masculine or
       female/woman/feminine. A nonbinary person may identify as neither a
       man nor a woman, in-between, both, fluidly moving between these two
       categories, or as a third/alternate gender. Related to the
       term genderqueer, which was used more often prior to the 2010’s.
     * Passing: Being perceived as cisgender or as a gender in line with
       one’s gender identity. This term is not considered affirming to
       many, as it implies that trans people are deceptive or are not
       truly the gender they say they are. Passing is important to some
       people (e.g., for safety reasons), but it is not the goal of every
       trans person.
     * Queer: Used to describe non-normative identities (both sexual
       identities and gender identities) that might not easily be
       classified under other terminology (gay, lesbian, etc.). Queer can
       also be used as an umbrella term to describe LGBTQIA identities as
       a whole. In many communities, the term “queer” also has a political
       connotation that is connected to LGBTQIA activism. The term queer
       may be offensive to older LGBTQIA individuals, so it is best to use
       caution and only use this term when you know that someone uses it
       as an affirming term to describe themselves.
     * Sexual Orientation: A way to describe a person’s romantic and/or
       sexual attractions to others. Sexual orientation may consist of
       attraction, behavior, and identity, and not all of these factors
       need to be aligned/consistent. For example, a person may have
       attractions towards trans women, be sexually active with cisgender
       men, and have an identity as heterosexual. Some labels to describe
       sexual orientation include: heterosexual, straight, lesbian, gay,
       bisexual, pansexual, queer, or fluid.
     * Transgender, Trans: An adjective to describe someone who does not
       fully identify with the sex they were assigned at birth. These
       terms are often used as umbrella terms for more specific terms that
       people within trans communities use to describe themselves (and
       sometimes a person may use several to describe themselves). Some of
       these terms include:
          + Man

     * Transgender Man, Trans Man, Trans Masculine: Someone who was female
       assigned at birth who identifies as a man or on the masculine
       spectrum. Note: The term FTM is no longer considered affirming.
     * Transgender Woman, Trans Woman, Trans Feminine: Someone who was
       male assigned at birth who identifies as a woman or on the feminine
       spectrum. Note: The term MTF is no longer considered affirming.
     * Transition: The process of shifting one’s gender identity and/or
       expression. Transition is a process that occurs over time, varies
       greatly among individuals, and may consist of physical/medical,
       emotional, social, and legal components. There is no uniform or set
       path for how a person transitions, if at all. Some transgender
       people consider themselves post-transition, and some no longer
       consider themselves to be transgender. Others feel that they are in
       a state of transition for the rest of their lives.
     * Transsexual: A term that was commonly used before the term
       “transgender” came into more popular usage in the 1990’s. Some
       people still identify as transsexual, but this term is no longer
       considered affirming.
