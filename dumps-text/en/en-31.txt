   Transgender is an umbrella term for anyone whose internal experience of
   gender does not match the sex they were assigned at birth (normally
   based on primary and secondary sex charateristics). Transgender people
   may experience discomfort or distress due to their gender not aligning
   with their sex, and therefore wish to transition to being the gender
   they identify with.

   Some transgender people feel this way from a very young age, while
   others go through a period of questioning before realizing they are
   transgender. Transgender people can be any gender. They can have any
   sexual orientation, express their gender through their appearance in
   any way, and may or may not fit into society's views of gender.

   People whose sex corresponds to their gender identity are referred to
   as cisgender.

Terminology

   There are a wide range of terms used in reference to transgender
   people, and the definitions of words often vary over time, or between
   different groups of people. it is always important to check in with
   individuals which words they prefer to use rather than to assign them
   labels they may not be comfortable with.

   Generally, all discussion of transgender people is focused on gender
   identity. For example, a trans man is someone who views themselves as a
   man and was assigned female at birth. It is his internal experience (as
   a man) which determines how he is described, not the way he is seen by
   society. Similarly, a trans woman views herself as a woman and was
   assigned male at birth. This can confuse those who are new to
   discussions of transgender identity, but it's an important distinction.

   This distinction is based on the understanding that gender and sex are
   separate, where 'gender' means internal experience, and 'sex' means the
   attributes of the body. Therefore, a woman (gender) can have a penis
   and XY chromosomes (sex), but this does not affect her self-identity as
   a woman, except for the possibility that she was raised to see herself
   as a man.

   Terms such as "male-bodied" and "female-bodied" are often seen as
   inappropriate because they confuse gender with sex. A trans woman is a
   woman, and therefore her body is female because it belongs to a woman.
   Instead, the terminology "assigned male/female/intersex at birth" is
   used to indicate whether a person is born male or female. This
   terminology also acknowledges that gender varies between societies, and
   some cultures recognize three or more genders.

   It is worth noting that some people are born with sex characteristics
   that cannot be easily classified as either male or female. This is
   known as being intersex, and many intersex individuals are unaware of
   their condition. Those who are not intersex are referred to as dyadic.

   Other important concepts are the gender binary and the gender spectrum.

   The gender binary refers to the idea that there are only two genders,
   man and woman, and that everyone can be categorized as one or the
   other. However, many people feel that their gender identity is
   non-binary and cannot be described as either of these identities.
   Another term used for people who fall outside the gender binary is
   genderqueer, which is often used to imply a desire to change the norms
   of gender.

   The gender spectrum on the other hand is the idea that gender isn't
   binary but a continuum. At it simplest is a line between male and
   female. The next step up is a 2D pane with male and female on the axis.
   The next step is adding in Aporagenders(genders not related to male or
   female) each on their own axis. The final step is Gender Field theory
   where gender is a N-dimensional field. For more on the different
   theories of gender see Models of gender identity.

Transition

   Transition is any action a transgender person takes in order for the
   external world to better recognize and reflect their internal gender.
   This can range from asking people to use different names and pronouns,
   to a change in dress or appearance, to extensive surgery. The three
   main forms of transition are social, legal, and medical, although all
   of these are broad categories which can reflect dozens of different
   possible actions.

   Transgender people often have dysphoria (feelings of distress) arising
   from their sex characteristics not matching their self-image and/or
   being seen and treated as the wrong gender (misgendered). This
   dysphoria may be referred to by the medical term of Gender Identity
   Disorder, for which the correct treatment is considered to be
   transition, accompanied by any necessary support to achieve the desired
   state.

   Some transgender people have gender euphoria (feelings of elation) from
   making or thinking about their body, gender expression and/or being
   seen and treated as prefered gender.

   Every transgender person has different desires for what they want (or
   do not want) to include in their transition, including surgery and
   other medical procedures. Transgender people who do not plan to have
   surgery are sometimes referred to as non-op; transsexual is sometimes
   used to refer to only those who do. It is important not to make
   assumptions about what is, was or will be involved in any individual
   person's transition.

   Some transgender people are aware of their condition as children and
   begin transitioning then, such as by taking puberty blockers to delay
   the development of sex characteristics until they are old enough to be
   allowed to medically transition. However, many attempt to reconcile
   themselves with living as their assigned gender, and only transition
   later in life when they realize they are not happy with the way things
   are. This may involve a period of questioning in which a person is
   uncertain of their gender identity, and wishes to explore before
   settling on a label for themselves.

   Even after transition, transgender people may not want to reflect
   societal stereotypes of their gender identity. For instance, a trans
   woman can be masculine, a tomboy, work as a mechanic, or hate wearing
   dresses - just as a cis woman can do any of those things.
