   Gender incongruence and transgender health in the ICD

What is the ICD?

   The International Classification serves to record and report health and
   health-related conditions globally. ICD ensures interoperability of
   digital health data, and their comparability. The ICD contains
   diseases, disorders, health conditions and much more. The inclusion of
   a specific category into ICD depends on utility to the different uses
   of ICD and sufficient evidence that a health condition exists.

ICD-11 and Gender Incongruence

   The 11^th edition of the International Statistical Classification of
   Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The newly revised ICD-11
   codes includes new changes to reflect modern understanding of sexual
   health and gender identity.

What does the ICD revision aim to do for transgender health?

   ICD-11 has redefined gender identity-related health, replacing outdated
   diagnostic categories like ICD-10’s “transsexualism” and “gender
   identity disorder of children” with “gender incongruence of adolescence
   and adulthood” and “gender incongruence of childhood”, respectively.
   Gender incongruence has been moved out of the “Mental and behavioural
   disorders” chapter and into the new “Conditions related to sexual
   health” chapter. This reflects current knowledge that trans-related and
   gender diverse identities are not conditions of mental ill-health, and
   that classifying them as such can cause enormous stigma.

   Inclusion of gender incongruence in the ICD-11 should ensure
   transgender people’s access to gender-affirming health care, as well as
   adequate health insurance coverage for such services. Recognition in
   the ICD also acknowledges the links between gender identity, sexual
   behaviour, exposure to violence and sexually transmitted infections.

What is Gender Incongruence?

   The bulk of the changes centered around the moving of "gender
   incongruence" from a classification of mental health to one of sexual
   health. In 2020, we have a better understanding of the issues
   surrounding this condition, and they are not related to a mental health
   condition.  Treating gender incongruence in a mental health chapter was
   causing additional stigma for an already stigmatized condition. WHO
   officials added the hope that adding this condition to a sexual health
   chapter of the ICD codes would "help increase access to care for health
   interventions" and "destigmatize the condition."

What is transgender and what are the main health concerns of transgender
people?

   Transgender people share many of the same health needs as the general
   population, but may have other specialist health-care needs, such as
   gender-affirming hormone therapy and surgery. However, evidence
   suggests that transgender people often experience a disproportionately
   high burden of disease, including in the domains of mental, sexual and
   reproductive health. Some transgender people seek medical or surgical
   transition, others do not.

What is gender-affirmative health care?

   Gender-affirmative health care can include any single or combination of
   a number of social, psychological, behavioural or medical (including
   hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and
   affirm an individual’s gender identity.
