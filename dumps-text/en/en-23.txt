Modules

Who Are Transgender People?

   Trans people experience significant health disparities. To reduce
   disparities, it is vital that we all learn
   more about transgender people and how to improve services for trans
   communities.

Words That Matter, Part 1

   Exploring core concepts related to gender, sex, and sexual orientation
   can help us understand different identities.

What's in a Pronoun?

   To be respectful it's important to ask everyone what pronoun they use,
   and then use those pronouns consistently.

Words That Matter, Part 2

   We've presented a number of trans related terms. Let's put them into
   context.

Facing Down Stigma

   Transgender people face stigma daily. Learn about the impact of
   transphobia on health outcomes.

Words That Matter, Part 3

   Let's apply some of these concepts in real world scenarios.

How To Be an Ally

   Review core concepts and learn some initial steps to becoming an ally
   to trans communities.
