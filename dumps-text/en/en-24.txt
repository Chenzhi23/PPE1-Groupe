   The rights of transgender or trans people - and whether they affect the
   rights of women - are often in the spotlight.

   This has led to legal disputes, protests and discussions about free
   speech.

   New government guidance aims to clarify how schools in England should
   treat transgender pupils.

What is trans and what does transgender mean?

   Gender identity is a term used by some to describe someone's sense of
   their gender.

   A transgender person's gender identity is not the same as the sex
   recorded on their original birth certificate.

   A transgender man is someone registered female at birth, but who
   identifies as a man.

   A transgender woman is someone registered male at birth, but who
   identifies as a woman.

   Trans is a shorter way of saying transgender.

   Gender dysphoria describes the "unease or dissatisfaction" some people
   feel about the difference between their biological sex and gender
   identity.

   Some people who do not consider themselves to have a solely male or
   female gender identity describe themselves as non-binary.

   A child's sex is recorded as male or female at birth, based on physical
   characteristics.

   Some people are born with chromosomal or other physical differences
   that can make this a complex judgement. They are sometimes referred to
   as intersex, or having differences of sexual development (DSD).

What is the DFE transgender guidance for schools?

   Under Department for Education (DFE) guidance issued in December 2023,
   teachers in England should tell parents if their child wants to change
   their gender identity at school.

   The Gender Questioning Guidance - which is not compulsory - says this
   should happen in the "vast majority of cases".

   In rare circumstances, teachers can decide to withhold information if
   revealing it could put a child at "significant risk" of harm.

   Schools should also "take a very cautious approach" if pupils want to
   use a new name, pronouns or uniform.

   Non-statutory guidance was issued to Northern Irish schools in 2019,
   and to Scottish schools in 2021. The Welsh government has not yet
   published guidance.

What medical support is available for children who want to change their
gender identity?

   Increasing numbers of children are being referred to the under-18s
   Gender Identity and Development Service (Gids) in England, especially
   those registered female at birth.

   NHS England says there were more than 5,000 referrals in 2021-2022,
   compared with 250 in 2011-12.

   Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust

   In some cases, young patients have been prescribed puberty blockers,
   which delay the onset of puberty. But the NHS says little is known
   about their long-term side effects.

   An independent review concluded that the current service is
   "unsustainable". It said that many children referred to Gids have
   complex needs, which can sometimes be overlooked after a gender
   dysphoria diagnosis.

   It called for a "fundamentally different" model of care for children.

   Following the review, the NHS decided puberty blockers should only be
   given to children and adolescents as part of clinical research.

   Gids will close in March 2024, and regional clinics will open, working
   alongside children's hospitals.

   Young people in Scotland can get a GP referral or refer themselves to
   the gender service at the Sandyford clinic.

   Those in Northern Ireland who want to talk to a specialist about their
   gender identity can use the Knowing Our Identity service.

   In Wales, children or teenagers can be referred or refer themselves to
   a specialist Gender Identity Clinic (GIC).

How many transgender people are there in the UK?

   In the 2021 census, 262,000 people aged 16 and over in England and
   Wales said their gender identity was different to their birth sex.

   Some academics raised concerns that the question may not have been
   understood, and that number could be an overestimate.

   The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it cannot be certain if
   that is the case, but the results were accurately processed and are
   broadly consistent with other estimates.

   A 2018 estimate by the government suggested there could be between
   200,000 and 500,000 people who identify as transgender across the UK as
   a whole.

What changes can transgender people make?

   Many transgender people live according to their chosen gender identity
   - including how they dress, and the name and pronouns they use.

   Some may take hormone medication, or have surgery.

   People can also apply to alter the gender listed on official documents.

   These social, physical and legal changes are known as transitioning.

   Under the Gender Recognition Act 2004, UK adults can get a gender
   recognition certificate (GRC) if they meet certain criteria:
     * having a gender dysphoria diagnosis
     * providing evidence of living full-time in their acquired gender for
       at least two years
     * making a declaration that they will live permanently in their
       acquired gender
     * are 18 or over
     * pay a £5 fee

   This means their acquired gender can be recorded on their birth,
   marriage and death certificates.

   You do not need a GRC to update your driving licence, passport or
   medical records.

   However, non-binary is not recognised as a gender on legal documents in
   the UK.

   About 7,000 certificates have been issued in England, Wales and
   Scotland.

What is happening to the rules about changing gender?

   In 2018, the UK government began considering changes to the law in
   England and Wales, which it said would make it easier for transgender
   people to alter their legal gender.

   It decided not to go ahead with some of the proposed changes, but did
   move the application process online and lowered the cost of a
   certificate.

   In 2022, Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) voted to remove the
   need for a medical diagnosis and lower the application age to 16.

   However, the UK government blocked this from becoming law because it
   said the draft law would conflict with equality protections applying
   across the whole of Great Britain.

   The Scottish government initially said it would challenge this decision
   in the courts, but subsequently confirmed it would abandon its appeal.

   Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville told the Scottish
   Parliament that the bill was "not in the bin, and awaits an incoming UK
   government that has more respect for devolution".

What do transgender rights mean for women-only spaces?

   There has been much debate about how to balance the rights of different
   groups within society.

   Much of this has focused on access to women-only spaces such as
   toilets, domestic abuse refuges and prisons.

   There has also been controversy about the participation of trans women
   in female-only categories in sports.

   Transgender people may wish to use services and facilities which align
   with their gender identity, whereas other groups say that these should
   be separated by birth sex.

   The Equality Act 2010 identifies a number of groups with protected
   characteristics - including gender reassignment and sex - and protects
   those groups from discrimination.

   But single-sex service providers can exclude transgender people where
   this is a ''proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim'', such
   as privacy or safety.

   However, some say the law is not clearly understood and women's
   sex-based rights are under threat.

   The Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that amending the
   Equality Act definition of "sex" to "biological sex" is worth further
   consideration.

   This would make it simpler for certain spaces to be single-sex,
   regardless of whether a person has a GRC.

   The UK government is considering the advice.
