   ["I'm a transgender woman. That means my birth certificate said 'male,'
      but I always knew I was a girl. I was so relieved when I told my mom
     about how I felt – and instead of being mad, she was supportive." -
                                                                    Grace]

      ["Though my birth certificate said female, I have always felt like a
        boy. I kept it inside for many years, spending countless sleepless
      nights being terrified of what my family and friends would think and
    worrying about being rejected at school. I finally transitioned to the
               man I am today when I was 20 years old. Though I have faced
            discrimination by many people since then, I have also received
                 invaluable support. That is what keeps me going." - Alex]

   Understanding what it is like to be transgender can be hard, especially
   if you have never met a transgender person.

   Transgender is a broad term that can be used to describe people whose
   gender identity is different from the gender they were thought to be
   when they were born. “Trans” is often used as shorthand for
   transgender.

   To treat a transgender person with respect, you treat them according to
   their gender identity, not their sex at birth. So, someone who lives as
   a woman today is called a transgender woman and should be referred to
   as “she” and “her.” A transgender man lives as a man today and should
   be referred to as “he” and “him.”

   (Note: NCTE uses both the adjectives “male” and “female” and the nouns
   “man” and “woman” to refer to a person’s gender identity.)

   Gender identity is your internal knowledge of your gender – for
   example, your knowledge that you’re a man, a woman, or another gender.
   Gender expression is how a person presents their gender on the
   outside.That might include behavior, clothing, hairstyle, voice or body
   characteristics. Everyone has a gender identity, including cisgender –
   or non-transgender – people. If someone’s gender identity matches the
   gender they were assigned at birth, then they are cisgender, or “cis"
   for short.

   Sex is often used in a medical or scientific contexts. Sex is a label —
   male or female — that you’re assigned by a doctor at birth based on the
   appearance of the genitals you’re born with. It doesn’t define who you
   are, or what your gender identity might turn out to be.

   When a person begins to live according to their gender identity, rather
   than the gender they were thought to be when they were born, this time
   period is called gender transition. Deciding to transition can take a
   lot of reflection. Many transgender people risk social stigma,
   discrimination, and harassment when they tell other people who they
   really are. Despite those risks, being open about one’s gender identity
   can be life-affirming and even life-saving.

   Possible steps in a gender transition may or may not include changing
   your clothing, appearance, name, or the pronoun people use to refer to
   you (like “she,” “he,” or “they”). If they can, some people change
   their identification documents, like their driver’s license or
   passport, to better reflect their gender. And some people undergo
   hormone therapy or other medical procedures to change their physical
   characteristics and make their body match the gender they know
   themselves to be. All transgender people are entitled to the same
   dignity and respect, regardless of whether or not they have been able
   to take any legal or medical steps.

   Some transgender people identify as neither a man nor a woman, or as a
   combination of male and female, and may use terms like nonbinary or
   genderqueer to describe their gender identity. Those who are nonbinary
   often prefer to be referred to as “they” and “them.”

   It is important to use respectful terminology, and treat transgender
   people as you would treat any other person. This includes using the
   name the person has asked you to call them (not their old name) as well
   as the pronouns they want you to use. If you aren’t sure what pronouns
   a person uses, just ask politely.
