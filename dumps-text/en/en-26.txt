Mapping Transgender Equality in the United States

The Bottom Line

   The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community has seen
   both significant progress and painful setbacks recently. The 2015
   Supreme Court ruling in favor of the freedom to marry was a major step
   toward legal equality, and there have been many successes since then at
   the federal, state, and local levels, including increased protections
   for transgender and gender non-conforming people. However, since the
   ruling, there have also been more than 200 anti-LGBT bills introduced
   in 20 states—and a recently leaked executive order draft suggests that
   the current administration intends to undermine established
   non-discrimination protections and open the door to a wide range of
   harms to the LGBT population.

   To help make sense of the current policy landscape in the states for
   LGBT people, and transgender people specifically, Mapping Transgender
   Equality in the United States looks at legal equality for transgender
   people across the country. The gender identity tally is comprised of 25
   state laws and policies in the five key categories of
   Non-Discrimination, LGBT Youth Laws and Policies, Health and Safety,
   Ability for Transgender People to Correct the Name and Gender Marker on
   Identity Documents, and Adoption and Parenting.

   In this rapidly changing legal landscape, the Movement Advancement
   Project maintains LGBT Equality Maps, which track LGBT equality,
   populations, and other data by state. The maps are updated daily as
   changes in law, policy, and legislation occur. All Equality Maps,
   including high-resolution JPEG versions, are available for publication.
   The LGBT Equality Maps allow websites to embed the maps easily and for
   free. Visit lgbtmap.org/equality-maps to learn more.

Sexual Orientation Policy Tally

   The term “sexual orientation” is loosely defined as a person’s pattern
   of romantic or sexual attraction to people of the opposite sex or
   gender, the same sex or gender, or more than one sex or gender. Laws
   that explicitly mention sexual orientation primarily protect or harm
   lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. That said, transgender people who
   are lesbian, gay or bisexual can be affected by laws that explicitly
   mention sexual orientation.

Gender Identity Policy Tally

   “Gender identity” is a person’s deeply-felt inner sense of being male,
   female, or something else or in-between. “Gender expression” refers to
   a person’s characteristics and behaviors such as appearance, dress,
   mannerisms and speech patterns that can be described as masculine,
   feminine, or something else. Gender identity and expression are
   independent of sexual orientation, and transgender people may identify
   as heterosexual, lesbian, gay or bisexual. Laws that explicitly mention
   “gender identity” or “gender identity and expression” primarily protect
   or harm transgender people. These laws also can apply to people who are
   not transgender, but whose sense of gender or manner of dress does not
   adhere to gender stereotypes.
