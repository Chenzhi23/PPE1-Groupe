usage note For transgender

   The term transgender has largely replaced the older term transsexual,
   which is now considered outdated, though some people within the
   community continue to identify with the word transsexual, especially
   older people. Transgender is a less clinical term, referring more to
   gender identity and gender expression than to physical sex
   characteristics or sexual orientation. It is also a more general and
   inclusive term: a transgender person may be nonbinary, gender-fluid,
   genderqueer, third gender, etc.
   Use of transgender as a noun (One of my colleagues is a transgender )
   is declining and is usually taken as offensive. And many people object
   to the adjectival variant transgendered (One of my colleagues is
   transgendered ) because the –ed suffix seems to imply that something
   happened to make the person transgender. See also trans, transsexual.
     * Compare cisgender.
     * See also trans*.
