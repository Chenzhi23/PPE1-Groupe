Transgender Day of Remembrance

   Press Statement

   Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State

   November 20, 2023

   Each year on November 20, the world recognizes Transgender Day of
   Remembrance - a day to commemorate the transgender, non-binary, and
   gender non-conforming persons who are targeted and killed for living
   authentically and courageously.  Trans individuals are a part of every
   country, every culture, and every faith tradition.  The United States
   honors Transgender Day of Remembrance to affirm the humanity and human
   rights of transgender persons globally.

   Transgender persons experience disproportionately high levels of
   homicide and assault.  Their families and loved ones too often see no
   justice.  Countries around the world must ensure every hate crime is
   fully investigated.

   This year, we re-commit ourselves to ensuring acceptance and support
   for transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming persons.  It is
   everyone's responsibility to ensure trans persons can live full lives
   of dignity, without fear of violence or harm.  Until then, we will
   continue to speak loudly and clearly to end transphobic violence and
   homicide.
