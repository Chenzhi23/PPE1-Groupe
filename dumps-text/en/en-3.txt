   two transgender individuals standing next to each other

   According to the APA Style guide, the term “transsexual” is largely
   outdated, but some people identify with it; this term should be used
   only for an individual who specifically claims it. While the term
   “transsexual” appears multiple times throughout this document, APA’s
   Committee on Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity is undertaking a
   systematic review of its use along with other terms. In the meantime,
   please refer to the Guidelines for Psychological Practice with
   Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People (PDF, 472KB) for more
   up-to-date language regarding transgender and gender nonconforming
   people.

   Transgender is an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity,
   gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically
   associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth. Gender
   identity refers to a person’s internal sense of being male, female or
   something else; gender expression refers to the way a person
   communicates gender identity to others through behavior, clothing,
   hairstyles, voice or body characteristics. “Trans” is sometimes used as
   shorthand for “transgender.” While transgender is generally a good term
   to use, not everyone whose appearance or behavior is
   gender-nonconforming will identify as a transgender person. The ways
   that transgender people are talked about in popular culture, academia
   and science are constantly changing, particularly as individuals’
   awareness, knowledge and openness about transgender people and their
   experiences grow.

What is the difference between sex and gender?

   Sex is assigned at birth, refers to one’s biological status as either
   male or female, and is associated primarily with physical attributes
   such as chromosomes, hormone prevalence, and external and internal
   anatomy. Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors,
   activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate
   for boys and men or girls and women. These influence the ways that
   people act, interact, and feel about themselves. While aspects of
   biological sex are similar across different cultures, aspects of gender
   may differ.

   Various conditions that lead to atypical development of physical sex
   characteristics are collectively referred to as intersex conditions.

Have transgender people always existed?

   Transgender persons have been documented in many indigenous, Western,
   and Eastern cultures and societies from antiquity until the present
   day. However, the meaning of gender nonconformity may vary from culture
   to culture.

What are some categories or types of transgender people?

   Many identities fall under the transgender umbrella. The term
   transsexual refers to people whose gender identity is different from
   their assigned sex. Often, transsexual people alter or wish to alter
   their bodies through hormones, surgery, and other means to make their
   bodies as congruent as possible with their gender identities. This
   process of transition through medical intervention is often referred to
   as sex or gender reassignment, but more recently is also referred to as
   gender affirmation. People who were assigned female, but identify and
   live as male and alter or wish to alter their bodies through medical
   intervention to more closely resemble their gender identity are known
   as transsexual men or transmen (also known as female-to-male or FTM).
   Conversely, people who were assigned male, but identify and live as
   female and alter or wish to alter their bodies through medical
   intervention to more closely resemble their gender identity are known
   as transsexual women or transwomen (also known as male-to-female or
   MTF). Some individuals who transition from one gender to another prefer
   to be referred to as a man or a woman, rather than as transgender.

   People who cross-dress wear clothing that is traditionally or
   stereotypically worn by another gender in their culture. They vary in
   how completely they cross-dress, from one article of clothing to fully
   cross-dressing. Those who cross-dress are usually comfortable with
   their assigned sex and do not wish to change it. Cross-dressing is a
   form of gender expression and is not necessarily tied to erotic
   activity. Cross-dressing is not indicative of sexual orientation. (See
   Answers to Your Questions: For a Better Understanding of Sexual
   Orientation and Homosexuality for more information on sexual
   orientation.) The degree of societal acceptance for cross-dressing
   varies for males and females. In some cultures, one gender may be given
   more latitude than another for wearing clothing associated with a
   different gender.

   The term drag queens generally refers to men who dress as women for the
   purpose of entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events. The
   term drag kings refers to women who dress as men for the purpose of
   entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events.

   Genderqueer is a term that some people use who identify their gender as
   falling outside the binary constructs of “male” and “female.” They may
   define their gender as falling somewhere on a continuum between male
   and female, or they may define it as wholly different from these terms.
   They may also request that pronouns be used to refer to them that are
   neither masculine nor feminine, such as “zie” instead of “he” or “she,”
   or “hir” instead of “his” or “her.” Some genderqueer people do not
   identify as transgender.

   Other categories of transgender people include androgynous,
   multigendered, gender nonconforming, third gender, and two-spirit
   people. Exact definitions of these terms vary from person to person and
   may change over time, but often include a sense of blending or
   alternating genders. Some people who use these terms to describe
   themselves see traditional, binary concepts of gender as restrictive.

Why are some people transgender?

   There is no single explanation for why some people are transgender. The
   diversity of transgender expression and experiences argues against any
   simple or unitary explanation. Many experts believe that biological
   factors such as genetic influences and prenatal hormone levels, early
   experiences, and experiences later in adolescence or adulthood may all
   contribute to the development of transgender identities.

How prevalent are transgender people?

   It is difficult to accurately estimate the number of transgender
   people, mostly because there are no population studies that accurately
   and completely account for the range of gender identity and gender
   expression.

What is the relationship between gender identity and sexual orientation?

   Gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same. Sexual
   orientation refers to an individual’s enduring physical, romantic,
   and/or emotional attraction to another person, whereas gender identity
   refers to one’s internal sense of being male, female, or something
   else. Transgender people may be straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or
   asexual, just as nontransgender people can be. Some recent research has
   shown that a change or a new exploration period in partner attraction
   may occur during the process of transition. However, transgender people
   usually remain as attached to loved ones after transition as they were
   before transition. Transgender people usually label their sexual
   orientation using their gender as a reference. For example, a
   transgender woman, or a person who is assigned male at birth and
   transitions to female, who is attracted to other women would be
   identified as a lesbian or gay woman. Likewise, a transgender man, or a
   person who is assigned female at birth and transitions to male, who is
   attracted to other men would be identified as a gay man.

How does someone know that they are transgender?

   Transgender people experience their transgender identity in a variety
   of ways and may become aware of their transgender identity at any age.
   Some can trace their transgender identities and feelings back to their
   earliest memories. They may have vague feelings of “not fitting in”
   with people of their assigned sex or specific wishes to be something
   other than their assigned sex. Others become aware of their transgender
   identities or begin to explore and experience gender-nonconforming
   attitudes and behaviors during adolescence or much later in life. Some
   embrace their transgender feelings, while others struggle with feelings
   of shame or confusion. Those who transition later in life may have
   struggled to fit in adequately as their assigned sex only to later face
   dissatisfaction with their lives. Some transgender people, transsexuals
   in particular, experience intense dissatisfaction with their sex
   assigned at birth, physical sex characteristics, or the gender role
   associated with that sex. These individuals often seek gender-affirming
   treatments.

What should parents do if their child appears to be transgender or gender
nonconforming?

   Parents may be concerned about a child who appears to be
   gender-nonconforming for a variety of reasons. Some children express a
   great deal of distress about their assigned sex at birth or the gender
   roles they are expected to follow. Some children experience difficult
   social interactions with peers and adults because of their gender
   expression. Parents may become concerned when what they believed to be
   a “phase” does not pass. Parents of gender-nonconforming children may
   need to work with schools and other institutions to address their
   children’s particular needs and ensure their children’s safety. It is
   helpful to consult with mental health and medical professionals
   familiar with gender issues in children to decide how to best address
   these concerns. It is not helpful to force the child to act in a more
   gender-conforming way. Peer support from other parents of
   gender-nonconforming children may also be helpful.

How do transgender individuals make a gender transition?

   Transitioning from one gender to another is a complex process and may
   involve transition to a gender that is neither traditionally male nor
   female. People who transition often start by expressing their preferred
   gender in situations where they feel safe. They typically work up to
   living full time as members of their preferred gender by making many
   changes a little at a time. While there is no “right” way to transition
   genders, there are some common social changes transgender people
   experience that may involve one or more of the following: adopting the
   appearance of the desired sex through changes in clothing and grooming,
   adopting a new name, changing sex designation on identity documents (if
   possible), using hormone therapy treatment, and/or undergoing medical
   procedures that modify their body to conform with their gender
   identity.

   Every transgender person’s process or transition differs. Because of
   this, many factors may determine how the individual wishes to live and
   express their gender identity. Finding a qualified mental health
   professional who is experienced in providing affirmative care for
   transgender people is an important first step. A qualified professional
   can provide guidance and referrals to other helping professionals.
   Connecting with other transgender people through peer support groups
   and transgender community organizations is also helpful.

   The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), a
   professional organization devoted to the treatment of transgender
   people, publishes The Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders,
   which offers recommendations for the provision of gender affirmation
   procedures and services.

Is being transgender a mental disorder?

   A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes
   significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not
   experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that
   identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For
   these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable
   resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and
   the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity
   and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress,
   including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect
   experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead
   many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related
   disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
   (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence
   can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria." Some contend that the
   diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should
   be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the
   diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of
   Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its
   current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as
   "gender identity disorder."

What kinds of discrimination do transgender people face?

   Anti-discrimination laws in most U.S. cities and states do not protect
   transgender people from discrimination based on gender identity or
   gender expression. Consequently, transgender people in most cities and
   states face discrimination in nearly every aspect of their lives. The
   National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and
   Lesbian Task Force released a report in 2011 entitled Injustice at
   Every Turn, which confirmed the pervasive and severe discrimination
   faced by transgender people. Out of a sample of nearly 6,500
   transgender people, the report found that transgender people experience
   high levels of discrimination in employment, housing, health care,
   education, legal systems, and even in their families.

   Transgender people may also have additional identities that may affect
   the types of discrimination they experience. Groups with such
   additional identities include transgender people of racial, ethnic, or
   religious minority backgrounds; transgender people of lower
   socioeconomic statuses; transgender people with disabilities;
   transgender youth; transgender elderly; and others. Experiencing
   discrimination may cause significant amounts of psychological stress,
   often leaving transgender individuals to wonder whether they were
   discriminated against because of their gender identity or gender
   expression, another sociocultural identity, or some combination of all
   of these.

   According to the study, while discrimination is pervasive for the
   majority of transgender people, the intersection of anti-transgender
   bias and persistent, structural racism is especially severe. People of
   color in general fare worse than White transgender people, with African
   American transgender individuals faring far worse than all other
   transgender populations examined.

   Many transgender people are the targets of hate crimes. They are also
   the victims of subtle discrimination—which includes everything from
   glances or glares of disapproval or discomfort to invasive questions
   about their body parts.

How can I be supportive of transgender family members, friends, or
significant others?

     * Educate yourself about transgender issues by reading books,
       attending conferences, and consulting with transgender experts. Be
       aware of your attitudes concerning people with gender-nonconforming
       appearance or behavior.
     * Know that transgender people have membership in various
       sociocultural identity groups (e.g., race, social class, religion,
       age, disability, etc.) and there is not one universal way to look
       or be transgender.
     * Use names and pronouns that are appropriate to the person’s gender
       presentation and identity; if in doubt, ask.
     * Don’t make assumptions about transgender people’s sexual
       orientation, desire for hormonal or medical treatment, or other
       aspects of their identity or transition plans. If you have a reason
       to know (e.g., you are a physician conducting a necessary physical
       exam or you are a person who is interested in dating someone that
       you’ve learned is transgender), ask.
     * Don’t confuse gender nonconformity with being transgender. Not all
       people who appear androgynous or gender nonconforming identify as
       transgender or desire gender affirmation treatment.
     * Keep the lines of communication open with the transgender person in
       your life.
     * Get support in processing your own reactions. It can take some time
       to adjust to seeing someone you know well transitioning. Having
       someone close to you transition will be an adjustment and can be
       challenging, especially for partners, parents, and children.
     * Seek support in dealing with your feelings. You are not alone.
       Mental health professionals and support groups for family, friends,
       and significant others of transgender people can be useful
       resources.
     * Advocate for transgender rights, including social and economic
       justice and appropriate psychological care.Familiarize yourself
       with the local and state or provincial laws that protect
       transgender people from discrimination.
