Who are Transgender People ? The Basics

   Publié le 10 février 2010 - modifié le 17 février 2010

   Transgender is an "umbrella" term used to describe a wide range of
   identities and experiences, and is used to refer to many types of
   people, including transsexual people ; crossdressers ; androgynous
   people ; genderqueers ; and other gender non-conforming people whose
   appearance or characteristics are perceived to be gender atypical.

   In its broadest sense, "transgender" encompasses anyone whose identity
   or behavior falls outside stereotypical gender expectations.
   It is important to understand that some people may identify as
   transgender but not fall into one of the subcategories discussed here.
   This publication attempts to identify many of the ways in which
   transgender individuals identify and express themselves, but this
   listing is in no way complete. Furthermore, it is particularly
   important to realize that many individuals, despite the fact that they
   may appear transgender to some, do not consider themselves to be
   transgender. It is important that we not label people transgender based
   on our perceptions, but instead use the words they use to describe
   themselves.
   All people have a gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person's
   internal sense of being male, female or something else. For most
   people, one's gender identity matches the sex assigned to them at
   birth--for example, a person born female typically identifies as a
   girl, and later, as a woman. For many transgender people, there may not
   be a match.

   All people also have a gender expression. Gender expression refers to
   all of the ways that people express their gender (or gender identity)
   to the outside world, including through dress, appearance, and
   behavior. For many transgender people, their gender expression doesn't
   match what society thinks it should be.

10 TRANSITIONING OUR SHELTERS, SOME DEFINITIONS

   Transgender : An "umbrella" term for people whose gender identity,
   expression or behavior is different from those typically associated
   with their assigned sex at birth, including but not limited to
   transsexuals, crossdressers, androgynous people, genderqueers, and
   gender non-conforming people. Transgender is a broad term and is good
   for providers to use.

   Transgender Man : A term for a transgender individual who currently
   identifies as a man (see also "FTM").

   Transgender Woman : A term for a transgender individual who currently
   identifies as a woman (see also "MTF").

   Gender Identity : An individual's internal sense of being male, female,
   or something else. Since gender identity is internal, one's gender
   identity is not necessarily visible to others.

   Gender Expression : How a person represents or expresses one's gender
   identity to others, often through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, voice
   or body characteristics.

   Transsexual : A term for people whose gender identity is different from
   their assigned sex at birth. Often, but not always, transsexual people
   alter their bodies through hormones or surgery in order to make it
   match
   their gender identity.

   Cross-dresser : A term for people who dress in clothing traditionally
   or stereotypically worn by the other sex, but who generally have no
   intent to live full-time as the other gender.

   Transvestite : A term for a cross-dresser that is considered derogatory
   by many.

   Genderqueer : A term used by some individuals who identify as neither
   entirely male nor entirely female.

   Genderqueer is an identity more common among young people.

   Gender Non-conforming : A term for individuals whose gender expression
   is different from the societal expectations based on their assigned sex
   at birth.

   Bi-gendered : One who has a significant gender identity that
   encompasses both genders, male and female. Some may feel that one side
   or the other is stronger, but both sides are there.

   Two-spirit : The definition of a two-spirit person varies across the
   Native American cultures in which they appear. In general, two-spirit
   people are born one sex, and end up fulfilling the roles assigned to
   both sexes, or other roles reserved for two-spirit people. Some people
   consider two-spirit a term that can refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual and
   transgender people, while others think it is best used only for
   transgender people.

   FTM : A person who has transitioned from "female-to-male," meaning a
   person who was assigned female at birth, but now identifies and lives
   as a male. Also known as a "transgender man."

   MTF : A person who has transitioned from "male-to-female," meaning a
   person who was assigned male at birth, but now identifies and lives as
   a female. Also known as a "transgender woman."

   Passing : A term used by transgender people to mean that they are seen
   as the gender they self-identify as. For example, a transgender man
   (born female) who most people see as a man.

   Sex Reassignment Surgery : Surgical procedures that change one's body
   to make it conform to a person's gender identity. This may include "top
   surgery" (breast augmentation or removal) or "bottom surgery" (altering
   genitals). Contrary to popular belief, there is not one surgery ; in
   fact there are many different surgeries. "Sex change surgery" is
   considered a derogatory term by many.

   Sexual Orientation : A term describing a person's attraction to members
   of the same sex or different sex. Usually defined as lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, or heterosexual.

   Transition : The period during which a person begins to live as their
   new gender. Transitioning may include changing one's name, taking
   hormones, having surgery, or changing legal documents (e.g. driver's
   license,
   Social Security number, birth certificate) to reflect their new gender.

   Intersex : A term used for people who are born with external genitalia,
   chromosomes, or internal reproductive systems that are not
   traditionally associated with either a "standard" male or female.

   Drag Queen : generally used to accurately refer to men who dress as
   women (often celebrity women) for the purpose of entertaining others at
   bars, clubs, or other events. It is also used as slang, sometimes in a
   derogatory manner, to refer to all transgender women.

   Drag King : used to refer to women who dress as men for the purpose of
   entertaining others at bars, clubs, or other events.

   These definitions are influenced by a variety of sources. See Patrick

   2003), Good Times ; Intersex Society of North America, www.isna.org the
