feminist activism works

This is Mama Cash

   Mama Cash supports women, girls, and trans and intersex people who
   fight for their rights. Activists who tirelessly and fearlessly make
   their voices heard. Who criticise oppressive or restrictive norms and
   practices, and lobby for fair laws. Who demand their political and
   economic rights, and insist on bodily
   autonomy.

   Together with these activists and our donors, we work towards a more
   just world for women, girls, and trans and intersex people.
