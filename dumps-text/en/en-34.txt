Transgender Health Program

Our statement of support

   The Dartmouth Health Transgender Medicine team is aware of the efforts
   to restrict the rights of trans youth to access gender affirming
   medical care. We want to assure our patients and their families that we
   remain steadfast in our commitment to providing you with the care that
   you seek, and the care that you deserve. Gender affirming care is
   grounded in science and we are proud to practice evidenced-based
   medicine that unequivocally leads to best physical and emotional
   outcomes for trans and gender diverse youth. On behalf of our entire
   team, we see you, we hear you, and we are here for you.

   The Transgender Health Program is dedicated to providing high-quality
   gender-affirming care to pediatric and adult patients.

   Our team includes experienced providers across various departments
   within the Dartmouth Health system. We are here to support you
   throughout all aspects of your gender transition.
