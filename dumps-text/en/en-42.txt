What Is Transgender?

   Diverse gender identities fall under the transgender umbrella

   Transgender is a term used to describe people whose gender identity
   does not conform with the gender they were assigned at birth. A person
   designated male at birth who identifies as female is a transgender
   woman, while a person designated female at birth who identifies as male
   is a transgender man.

   In recent years, transgender has become an umbrella term that includes
   not only people who are binary (male or female) but also those who are
   non-binary or gender-non-conforming.

   Gender affirmation, or the process of aligning one's outward expression
   of gender with one's inward sense of gender, is central to the
   transgender identity. Medical treatments or surgery may be involved,
   but not always.

   This article explains what it means to be transgender, including the
   terminology used and how to use it correctly. It also describes the
   process of gender affirmation and some of the serious challenges faced
   by transgender people today.

What It Means to Be Transgender

   Transgender traditionally means to identify as male if you were
   assigned female at birth or to identify as female if you were assigned
   male at birth. And, to many, that remains the definition of
   "transgender," described on the male-female binary.

   But not everyone sees gender in the same way.

   Those who are non-binary view gender on a spectrum where roles and
   expectations aren't automatically assigned based on what genitals a
   person is born with. As such, a non-binary person may identify as male
   and female, as neither male nor female, or as their own unique gender
   (described by some as the "third gender").

   In the current vernacular, non-binary people may fall under the
   "transgender umbrella" when they consciously move away from expected
   gender roles and align themselves, their presentation, and sometimes
   their bodies with their own gender identity.

   In the end, gender identity is one's internal sense of gender even if
   that means no gender at all. Examples include:
     * Agender: Identifying with no gender
     * Bigender: Identifying with both male and female gender
       characteristics
     * Cisgender: Identifying with the sex you were assigned at birth
     * Genderfluid or genderqueer: Shifting between genders or outside of
       society's expectations of gender
     * Pangender or polygender: Displaying or experiencing parts of all
       genders
     * Third Spirit: An umbrella term that describes different sexualities
       and genders in Indigenous Native American people

Gender Identity vs. Sexual Orientation

   Gender and sex are not the same thing, and neither are gender identity
   and sexual orientation.

   Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender, which can
   correspond to a person's assigned sex or differ from it. Sexual
   orientation is a person's identity in relation to the gender or
   genders they are sexually attracted to.

Gender Affirmation and Gender Expression

   Whether binary or non-binary, the one characteristic that connects all
   transgender people is that the gender assigned to them at birth does
   not match their own internal sense of gender identity.

   This mismatch can be felt from as early as three to five years in some
   transgender children. Others may not recognize it until puberty when
   changes in their bodies create a palpable sense of unease about their
   gender and all that implies. Others still may not recognize this until
   later in life.

   This uneasiness is referred to as gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is
   not a psychological illness. It simply describes distress caused by the
   misalignment of a person's assigned gender and gender identity.

   In response to gender dysphoria, a transgender person may pursue gender
   affirmation in its different forms to align their gender identity
   (their inward sense of gender) with their gender expression (their
   outward expression of their gender).

   Gender affirmation (formerly known as gender transitioning) can include
   one or all of the following:
     * Social affirmation, which may involve changing your name and
       pronouns, your manner (such as the way you sit and talk), your
       appearance (such as your clothing and hair), and the washroom you
       use
     * Legal affirmation, which may involve changing your name and gender
       on your driver's license, birth certificate, bank accounts,
       passport, medical records, and other governmental and
       non-governmental records
     * Medical affirmation, which may involve gender-affirming hormone
       therapy and gender-affirming surgeries (such as breast
       augmentation, vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, orchiectomy, or facial
       feminization)

Do All Transgender People Have Surgery?

   Despite what many people think, a person does not have to undergo
   medical treatments to be transgender. Social and/or legal affirmation
   may be far more important to some people.

   While many transgender people will take hormones to align their
   physical expression with their gender identity, there are many who
   don't and have no desire to.

Terminology and Appropriate Usage

   Transgender is an adjective (as in "he is a transgender man"). It is
   not used as a noun (such as "he is a transgender")" or a verb ("he is
   transgendered").

   "Trans" is often used as a shorthand for transgender, so it is usually
   acceptable to describe a transgender man as a trans man and a
   transgender woman as a trans woman.

   If someone identifies as transgender, you would typically use the
   pronouns "he" and "him" for a transgender man and "she" and "her" for a
   transgender woman. Even so, non-binary or gender-non-conforms people
   may prefer "them" and "they" or other pronouns, so ask first if you are
   unsure.

   If in doubt, err on the side of caution by offering your pronouns first
   and then asking the person what pronouns they use.

   Mistakes can occur, but to intentionally or repeatedly use the wrong
   pronouns is a disrespectful act known as misgendering.

   Equally disrespectful is calling someone by their "dead name" (their
   name prior to gender affirmation) rather than their "affirmed name."
   This is true even if you're a family member or have grown up with that
   person.

Terms to Avoid

   There are other terms that have been displaced because they
   mischaracterize was being transgender is about. Others still are
   considered offensive and should never be used.

   These include:
     * Biological sex: "Biological" is often construed to mean authentic
       as in "biologically male" or "biologically female." It also
       suggests that genitals are physical and gender identity is somehow
       psychological.
     * Gender-confirming: A transgender person does not need to confirm or
       "prove" their gender. A transgender person affirms their gender by
       asserting their authentic self. Gender-affirming surgery is
       preferred, for example, over gender-confirming surgery.
     * Gender reassignment: In the same vein, a transgender person's
       gender is not changed or reassigned. This is especially true if you
       are non-binary and identify as neither male nor female.
     * Sex change: This is an outdated and largely offensive term that
       suggests that being transgender is about changing one's genitals.
     * Transsexual: This is another outdated and offensive term that
       equates transgender identity with surgery, such as when describing
       a "pre-op transsexual" and "post-op transsexual."
     * Tranny, She-Male, or She-He: These are defamatory terms used to
       dehumanize transgender people.
     * Transgenderism: This is a term used by anti-trans activists that
       suggests that there is a movement to "recruit" or "push" people
       toward becoming transgender.

Discrimination and Transphobia

   It is estimated that about 0.5% of adults in the United States (1.3
   million) and 1.4% of youth between the ages of 13 and 17 years (or
   300,000) identify as transgender.

   Studies have shown that being transgender in the United States is
   fraught with challenges, including transphobia and discrimination in
   all realms of employment, education, healthcare, safety, and daily
   living.

   The National Transgender Discrimination Survey is the largest survey to
   assess the experiences of transgender people in the United States. It
   has been performed twice--first in 2008 with 6,450 respondents and then
   in 2013 with more than 27,000

   Both reports described high rates of discrimination across every facet
   of life. Discrimination took the form of everything from verbal
   harassment to sexual assault, and many individuals were forced to leave
   school or jobs as a result of those experiences.

   Transgender individuals also reported many experiences of
   discrimination in health care. Many individuals were denied access to
   gender-affirming medical and surgical care.

   Perhaps even more disturbing, numerous people reported being denied
   access to emergency care and general medical care as well as verbal and
   physical harassment in healthcare spaces.

   Because of this, many transgender people report avoiding medical care,
   for fear of experiencing additional discrimination or abuse. Others
   report avoiding care because they lacked financial or other resources.

   Among the key statistics:
     * One in six trans children has had to leave or change schools due to
       mistreatment.
     * One in four trans children has been physically attacked.
     * One in eight trans children has been sexually assaulted.
     * Nearly half of all trans people were sexually assaulted over the
       course of their lifetime.
     * One in three trans adults has been fired, denied a promotion, or
       experienced mistreatment in the workplace due to their gender
       expression.
     * One in three trans people has experienced mistreatment in
       healthcare, ranging from the refusal of service to verbal,
       physical, or sexual abuse.

   Discrimination is even worse for transgender people of color, who may
   experience bias based on both their skin color and their gender
   identity.

   The survey found that Latinx, American Indian, multiracial, and Black
   respondents were more than three times as likely as the general U.S.
   population to be living in poverty.

How to Be an Ally

   Gender diversity is a normal part of a functioning society and has been
   reported throughout history. Although transgender individuals have an
   increased risk of certain negative health outcomes, research suggests
   that this does not reflect any inherent issue with being transgender.
   Instead, it reflects the minority stress related to being part of a
   society that may not be accepting.

   Indeed, research suggests that one of the most important factors
   associated with the health of transgender people is access to an
   affirming environment and desired medical care. This is particularly
   true for transgender children and adolescents, who have been shown to
   do as well as their cisgender peers when their families are supportive
   and accepting.

   While not all transgender individuals are interested in medical or
   surgical affirmation, all people need health care at some point during
   their lives. Therefore, it is important to make all healthcare
   facilities safe and affirming for people of diverse genders. Lack of
   access to affirming health care is a risk factor for health concerns
   for transgender people of all ages.
