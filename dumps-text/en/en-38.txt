Creating Opportunities for Women to Grow: Lady Tee's Journey to Advocacy

   Lady Tee

   Lady Tee Thompson knows that when it comes to securing equal rights and
   opportunities for everyone -- regardless of their gender, race,
   physical abilities, or socioeconomic status -- progress does not come
   easy.

   She's worked with public institutions in her home state of Michigan to
   protect access to education for women and marginalized students. And
   she's taken on some of the most entrenched societal failures, from food
   insecurity to lack of economic opportunity, that are holding girls and
   women back around the world.

   She shares how her experiences as a disabled, marginalized, and
   minority woman entrepreneur have shaped and inspired her lifelong
   efforts to ensure women of all backgrounds have access to education and
   opportunity.

What first motivated you to become an advocate for girls and women?

   My first experience with advocacy was in 1989, when I was the student
   government president at Highland Park Community College. At the time it
   was the only HBCU (historically Black colleges and universities) in
   Michigan, and women made up a majority of the student body. Highland
   Park was a vital institution of higher education, offering underserved
   communities in the Detroit area opportunities to further their
   education and build careers, especially in the medical field; it was
   home to a top-graduating nursing program.

   Unfortunately, the school was experiencing financial and administrative
   challenges, and by the time I was serving on student government,
   Highland Park was on the brink of closure. So I worked directly with
   the Michigan Board of Education to keep the school open for as long as
   possible.

   It was intimidating to speak before a big institution like the Board of
   Education as a young student, but I was determined to keep the school
   open. If Highland Park had shut its doors then, the most marginalized
   students -- those who were low income or homeless, physically disabled,
   or lacked access to technology at home -- would have been the most
   severely affected.

   In the end, I managed to help keep Michigan's top-graduating two-year
   HBCU open for several more years. Sadly, the school ultimately closed,
   but I am proud that I was able to help more women and marginalized
   students change their socioeconomic trajectories in those final years.

   Being the voice of my community -- representing Highland Park Community
   College -- before a massive institution was a turning point for me. I
   realized that I could have a seat at the proverbial table. From that
   point on, I realized that I could help make a difference for those who
   were most at risk of being left behind. My passion for advancing
   equality -- especially gender equality -- grew from there.

   And just as important, it helped me to see that making a real
   difference means overcoming more than one obstacle. It takes
   persistence to knock down barrier after barrier to progress. Achieving
   a gender-equal world means repealing discriminatory laws and practices,
   educating, protecting, and promoting the rights of girls and women at
   every turn.

     "Achieving a gender-equal world means repealing discriminatory laws
     and practices, educating, protecting, and promoting the rights of
     girls and women at every turn."
     -Lady Tee Thompson

How did you find the courage and the confidence to represent students before
the state's Board of Education?

   I had a fantastic mentor: Congressman John Conyers Jr. He served in the
   U.S. House of Representatives for over half a century and remains the
   longest-serving African American member of the House. He taught me how
   to effectively advocate against a huge institution like the Michigan
   Board of Education, and he personally taught me about equality, equity,
   and inclusion.

   As a champion for justice and equality himself, Congressman Conyers
   helped me understand that we all have a civic duty to eliminate
   discrimination, even -- and especially -- if that means going up
   against institutions or harmful norms in our societies. That is how
   progress happens for all of us. That is how we can ensure equality for
   everyone, everywhere.

That's a valuable perspective, especially since progress on gender equality
has been slow, stagnant, and set back by recent crises. Where have you found
progress since your time at Highland Park?

   Over the past two decades, I've shifted from local to global advocacy
   with a focus on supporting women entrepreneurs around the world.

   I had a pivotal moment in 2015 after speaking at a women's empowerment
   conference in West Africa. Several of the women I met were leading
   farming cooperatives and shared that they not only lacked land rights,
   but they couldn't receive the training they needed to scale up their
   businesses -- just because they were women.

   Ninety days later, I launched an agricultural and entrepreneur training
   firm: AgroBiz.org. To date, we have mentored over 50,000 girls and
   women across the U.S. and 14 other countries. Our support takes a
   variety of forms, from bringing women farmers from Africa to the U.S.
   for learning tours to educational programming on everything from
   precision agriculture to launching and growing microenterprises.

   Economic empowerment and food security are two sides of the same coin,
   and both are essential to gender equality. In fact, according to the
   Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of hungry people in the
   world could fall by as much as 150 million if women farmers were
   guaranteed access to the same resources as men.

How has your engagement with the United Nations Association of the USA
(UNA-USA) contributed to your gender advocacy efforts?

   Joining UNA-USA was a natural fit. As the current co-Chair of the
   Women's Affinity Group, I'm empowered to directly discuss and challenge
   systemic gender inequalities and inequities. And as a Global Goals
   Ambassador, I've been able to continue advocating for the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) in new ways and places.

   economic growth (SDG8). Photo: Lady Tee Thompson

   For example, I traveled to Kwara State in Nigeria in early 2023 where I
   visited a local company run by KAM Holdings that manufactures steel
   nails. The best part? It's an all-women workforce, and their
   manufacturing process produces zero steel waste. It's a great example
   of how progress on one SDG unlocks progress across the entire
   framework, in this case, from Gender Equality (SDG 5) to Decent Work
   and Economic Growth (SDG 8) to Sustainable Consumption and Production
   (SDG 12). Seeing how innovative they were in order to ensure zero steel
   manufacturing waste and align their work with the SDGs was encouraging.
   But it was their dedication to the economic empowerment of women in
   their community that rejuvenated my soul and reaffirmed my faith that
   equality everywhere is possible.

What does #EqualEverywhere mean to you?

   It means bringing a global, gender-specific lens to our laws, cultural
   norms, homes, workplaces, and communities. It means accounting for
   girls and women -- and especially marginalized women -- in everything
   we do, and everywhere we do it. It's the only way we can build truly
   inclusive communities and societies. And we'll be able to do it only if
   everyone is an advocate for gender equality.
