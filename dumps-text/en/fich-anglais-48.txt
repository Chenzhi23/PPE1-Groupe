Become a Partner in Pride

Support LGBTIQ community organizations working for justice and equality

   Leaders of LGBTIQ organizations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and
   Democratic Republic of Congo work and live in environments
   characterized by violent homophobia, legally entrenched discrimination,
   and political and social persecution. These human rights defenders put
   their safety on the line every day to lead organizations that stand up
   for the human rights and health of LGBTIQ communities. Far too often,
   they are doing it alone.

   You can be a part of changing that. Help us get LGBTIQ organizations
   the funds they need.

   The SLF’s Partners in Pride campaign supports these organizations,
   which are lifelines for their communities. They provide vital services,
   including health care, mental health supports, social supports, and
   legal counsel.

   The last year has been a difficult one for our LGBTIQ partner
   organizations. Widespread discrimination, pervasive stigma, and
   barriers to social and legal support have led to human rights
   violations and exacerbated the impacts of HIV on LGBTIQ communities.
   Yet, our LGBTIQ partners continue to provide life-saving programs and
   to fight for the right to exist free from stigma, discrimination, and
   criminalization.

   “We are driven by the conviction that we are part of a larger story of
   global human rights, and we will not give up until we have built the
   future we deserve.” – Frank Mugisha

Pride Talks Highlights

   Hear from Biggie, Executive Director of Freedom and Roam Uganda
   (FARUG). Biggie is a social justice warrior and activist who is
   unapologetic about her work with the LGBTIQ community, standing up to
   stigma and discrimination often imposed by politicians and religious
   leaders who cling to colonial-era, anti-LGBTIQ laws that encourage
   hatred and curtail human rights.
   Sexual Minorities Uganda-Quchu Leadership Academy
   Mentoring up-and-coming LGBTIQ community leaders through workshops,
   training, and debates, Sexual Minorities Uganda’s Quchu Leadership
   Academy empowers human-rights defenders to grow the LGBTIQ movement.

   HAPA-Kenya Drop-In Centre
   Stigma-free care at HIV & AIDS People’s Alliance of Kenya provides a
   step toward health equity for LGBTIQ communities. During the COVID-19
   pandemic, HAPA-Kenya adapted services to enhance food security, improve
   access to HIV medication, and respond to increased incidents of
   violence against community members. Photo provided by HAPA-Kenya.
   Outreach and community engagement are central to defending human
   rights, and providing HIV services to communities that may not be able
   to access services in clinics. BHESP in Kenya provides mobile health
   care to communities surrounding Nairobi.

   friendship centre in Democratic Republic of the Congo provides access
   to stigma-free health care, including voluntary HIV testing,
   prevention, and treatment. Photo provided by RSM.
   Many of the SLF’s partners emphasize the urgent need to invest in the
   LGBTIQ community’s mental as well as physical health. Icebreakers
   Uganda, for example, held activities and workshops to mark World Mental
   Health Day in October 2022. Photo credit: Sofi Lundin
