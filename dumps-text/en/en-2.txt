     * Transgender Identity Terms and Labels

   Many people believe there are only two genders: man and woman. This is
   known as the gender binary. But that's not how every person experiences
   their own gender.

   If your gender is different from the "male" or "female" label on your
   original birth certificate, you may identify as transgender. If your
   gender doesn't fit into the gender binary, you may identify as
   nonbinary.

What's gender identity?

   Gender identity describes the inner experience of your own gender --
   whether you feel like a man, woman, genderqueer, agender, nonbinary, or
   another identity.

   Remember: There's no right or wrong way to look like a woman, man, or
   nonbinary person.

What does transgender mean?

   Transgender means your gender identity is different from the gender
   that the doctor gave you when you were born, based on the way your body
   looked. That label is called "sex assigned at birth" -- usually "male"
   or "female."

   Transgender people use different terms to describe themselves. Always
   use the language and labels that a person uses for themselves.

What does nonbinary mean?

   If your gender doesn't fit under the label of either "male" or
   "female," then you may identify as nonbinary. Your gender identity may
   be nonbinary if you're: both a man and a woman, in between, or totally
   outside those categories.

What does cisgender mean?

   If you have the same gender identity as the sex the doctor assigned you
   at birth, you're "cisgender" -- like a man who was assigned male at
   birth or a woman who was assigned female at birth.

What's gender expression?

   How someone expresses their gender identity is called gender
   expression.

   Like cisgender people, transgender people express their gender
   identities in different ways -- through dress, behavior, mannerisms,
   and more.

What's a gender modality?

   "Cisgender" and "transgender" are key gender modalities. Your gender
   modality describes whether your gender identity corresponds to your sex
   assigned at birth. For example, a cisgender woman's gender modality is
   "cisgender" and her gender identity is "woman."

   Transgender is both a gender identity and a gender modality. For
   example, a woman who was assigned male at birth may have a gender
   identity of "transgender woman" or "woman." Her gender modality may be
   "transgender" or "not cisgender."

What's gender dysphoria?

   Many trans and nonbinary people experience gender dysphoria. Gender
   dysphoria is distress, unhappiness, and anxiety related to the mismatch
   between your gender identity and important aspects of your body -- such
   as your genitals, voice, or chest. You also can have gender dysphoria
   if you're treated socially as the wrong gender, like when people use
   the wrong pronouns for you.

   While psychologists used to call gender dysphoria "gender identity
   disorder," being transgender and/or nonbinary isn't a mental illness.
   Challenges and distress can be common for trans and nonbinary folks
   because of transphobia (AKA transmisia) -- the ways that society treats
   transgender and nonbinary people as less than human.

   Not everyone experiences gender dysphoria. When they do, it can be
   different for each person. The same is true for gender euphoria.

What's gender euphoria?

   Gender euphoria is the joy, relief, or well-being that many transgender
   and nonbinary people feel in their gender identity. Gender euphoria
   might happen when someone feels harmony between their gender identity
   and their body and/or their gender expression. Gender euphoria also
   occurs when someone is treated socially in alignment with their gender
   identity, like when people use affirming gendered language. An example
   would be a trans woman feeling good when she's called "ma'am."

   Gender euphoria can be a benefit of transitioning -- making changes to
   live in harmony with your gender identity. Trans people use different
   kinds of transition to feel more like their gender identity.

Is transgender a sexual orientation?

   Nope! People often confuse gender identity, which is about who you are
   inside, with sexual orientation, which is about who you're attracted
   to. Sexual orientation -- like lesbian, gay, bisexual, and more --
   describes sexual or romantic attraction to different genders. Gender
   modality and gender identity are about what gender you are, not what
   gender you're attracted to.

   Just like transgender people can have any gender identity or gender
   expression, they can also have any sexual or romantic orientation.

What does passing mean?

   Passing means others see you as the gender that you identify as. For
   example, a transgender woman seen as a cisgender woman is "passing."

   Some transgender people feel that passing is important emotionally
   because it affirms their gender identity. They may experience passing
   as a positive thing that sparks gender euphoria.

   Other transgender people don't care about passing or don't want to "be
   read" as cisgender. For them, passing suggests transgender and
   nonbinary people have to look and sound like cisgender people for their
   gender identity to be "real." They may also see passing as accepting
   transphobia/transmisia -- that the only trans people who get to be safe
   are the ones who don't "look trans."

   Because of transphobia/transmisia, passing can provide safety from
   harassment and violence. Someone who passes is likely to have an easier
   time moving through the world than a person who's seen as transgender.
   This person has "passing privilege."

   No matter what a person "looks like," their gender identity is always
   valid and real.

Where can I get safe gender-affirming medical care?

   You deserve safe health care. To find an affordable trans-competent
   nurse or doctor, it can be helpful to do an internet search, ask trans
   and nonbinary people in your community, or talk to someone from a local
   LGBTQ+ community organization.

   Planned Parenthood health centers serve people of all genders. Anyone
   can visit their nearest Planned Parenthood health center for STD
   testing, birth control, physical exams, other sexual and reproductive
   health services, and referrals. Find your nearest Planned Parenthood
   health center and learn about the services it offers.

   Many Planned Parenthood health centers are able to offer
   gender-affirming hormone treatment (sometimes called GAHT). The best
   way to learn about the services available in your area is to contact
   your nearest Planned Parenthood health center.

   If your closest Planned Parenthood health center doesn't offer
   gender-affirming hormone treatments, and you want them to, you can tell
   them. Hearing from patients helps your nearest Planned Parenthood add
   services that you need. They may be able to recommend a trans-friendly
   doctor in your area who provides the services you need.
