Filling gaps in gender diversity data in Canada

   Prior to the 2021 Census, some individuals indicated that they were not
   able to see themselves in the two responses of male or female on the
   existing sex question in the census.

   Following extensive consultation and countrywide engagement with the
   Canadian population, the census evolved—as it has for more than a
   century—to reflect societal changes, adding new content on gender
   in 2021.

   Beginning in 2021, the precision of "at birth" was added to the sex
   question on the census questionnaire, and a new question on gender was
   included. As a result, the historical continuity of information on sex
   was maintained while allowing all cisgender, transgender and non-binary
   individuals to report their gender. This addressed an important
   information gap on gender diversity (see Filling the gaps: Information
   on gender in the 2021 Census and 2021 Census: Sex at birth and
   gender—the whole picture).

   For many people, their gender corresponds to their sex at birth
   (cisgender men and cisgender women). For some, these do not align
   (transgender men and transgender women) or their gender is not
   exclusively "man" or "woman" (non-binary people).

   The strength of the census is to provide reliable data for local
   communities throughout the country and for smaller populations such as
   the transgender and non-binary populations. Statistics Canada always
   protects privacy and confidentiality of respondents when disseminating
   detailed data.

   These modifications reflect today's reality in terms of the evolving
   acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual diversity and an
   emerging social and legislative recognition of transgender, non-binary
   and LGBTQ2+ people in general, that is, people who are lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, or who use other terms
   related to gender or sexual diversity. In 2017, the Canadian government
   amended the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Criminal Code to
   protect individuals from discrimination and hate crimes based on gender
   identity and expression.

   These data can be used by public decision makers, employers, and
   providers of health care, education, justice, and other services to
   better meet the needs of all men and women—including transgender men
   and women—and non-binary people in their communities.

Highlights

   The 2021 Census of Population included for the first time a question on
   gender and the precision of "at birth" on the sex question, allowing
   all cisgender, transgender and non-binary individuals to report their
   gender.

   Canada is the first country to collect and publish data on gender
   diversity from a national census.

   Of the nearly 30.5 million people in Canada aged 15 and older living in
   a private household in May 2021, 100,815 were transgender (59,460) or
   non-binary (41,355), accounting for 0.33% of the population in this age
   group.

   The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were three to
   seven times higher for Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2006, 0.79%)
   and millennials (born between 1981 and 1996, 0.51%) than for Generation
   X (born between 1966 and 1980, 0.19%), baby boomers (born
   between 1946 and 1965, 0.15%) and the Interwar and Greatest Generations
   (born in 1945 or earlier, 0.12%).

   Over time, the acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual
   diversity has evolved. Further, there has been social and legislative
   recognition of transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people in general.
   Younger generations may be more comfortable reporting their gender
   identity than older generations.

   In May 2021, the Canadian population aged 15 and older had an average
   age of 48.0 years. In comparison, the transgender population had an
   average age of 39.4 years, while the non-binary population had an
   average age of 30.4 years.

   Just under 1 in 100 young adults aged 20 to 24 were non-binary or
   transgender (0.85%).

   Nova Scotia (0.48%), Yukon (0.47%) and British Columbia (0.44%) had the
   highest proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 and
   older among provinces and territories.

   Victoria (0.75%), Halifax (0.66%) and Fredericton (0.60%) had the most
   gender diversity among Canadian large urban centres.

   Just over half of non-binary people aged 15 and older (52.7%) lived in
   one of Canada's six largest urban centres: Toronto (15.3%), Montréal
   (11.0%), Vancouver (10.8%), Ottawa–Gatineau (5.6%), Edmonton (5.4%) and
   Calgary (4.5%).

   Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary people aged 15 and older (15.5%) lived in the
   downtown core of a large urban centre. This share was more than twice
   that of transgender people (7.0%) and over three times higher than that
   of cisgender people (4.7%).

One in 300 people in Canada aged 15 and older are transgender or non-binary

   Thumbnail for Infographic 1: One in 300 people in Canada aged 15 and

   In May 2021, there were 59,460 people in Canada aged 15 and older
   living in a private household who were transgender (0.19%)
   and 41,355 who were non-binary (0.14%). Together, they
   represented 1 in 300 people, or 0.33% of the population aged 15 and
   older.

Counting transgender people in the 2021 Census and data comparability

   Canada is the first country to collect and publish data on gender
   diversity from a national census. While Canada's census data and
   surveys from other countries are not strictly comparable, they provide
   valuable insight into gender diversity globally.

   In Canada, 0.2% of the population aged 18 and older was transgender
   in 2021. Belgium (0.5% among people aged 18 to 75 in 2021) and New
   Zealand (0.5% among people aged 18 and older in 2020) have also
   published representative survey-based data on their transgender
   populations.

   Other countries have published 2021 data on transgender people using
   crowdsourcing and non-representative surveys, including Ireland (0.6%
   among people aged 18 and older), England and Wales (0.6% among people
   aged 16 and older), and the United States (0.8% among people
   aged 18 and older).

   Among the 59,460 transgender people, there were more transgender women
   (31,555) than transgender men (27,905).

The transgender and non-binary generation gap

   Over time, the acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual
   diversity has evolved. Further, there has been social and legislative
   recognition of transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people in general.
   Younger generations may be more comfortable reporting their gender
   identity than older generations.

   The Canadian population aged 15 and older can be divided into six
   generations, each born in a different period. The following generations
   (and their age groups in May 2021) are based on work from the Pew
   Research Center and existing literature, and are consistent with the
   Census in Brief: A generational portrait of Canada's aging population
   from the 2021 Census:

   Greatest Generation: people aged 94 or older (born before 1928)

   Interwar Generation: people aged 76 to 93 (born between 1928 and 1945)

   Baby boomers: people aged 56 to 75 (born between 1946 and 1965)

   Generation X: people aged 41 to 55 (born between 1966 and 1980)

   Generation Y (millennials): people aged 25 to 40 (born
   between 1981 and 1996)

   Generation Z: people aged 15 to 24 (born between 1997 and 2006)

   Younger generations had larger shares of those who were transgender or
   non-binary. The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were
   three to seven times higher for Generation Z (0.79%) and millennials
   (0.51%) than for Generation X (0.19%), baby boomers (0.15%) and the
   Interwar and Greatest Generations (0.12%).

   Each generation holds attitudes and demonstrates behaviours informed by
   the historical context in which its members were raised. Generation Z
   was born in the Internet age, and millennials came of age during a time
   when the Internet was changing the way we gather and process
   information. The Internet, along with social media and web-connected
   personal devices, may have contributed to the increasing awareness of
   gender diversity—especially among younger generations—by providing
   transgender and non-binary individuals with virtual support communities
   and answers to questions that were less accessible to older
   generations.

Non-binary and transgender people are younger on average than cisgender people

   Chart 2: Gender diversity is highest among 20- to 24-year-olds

   In May 2021, the Canadian population aged 15 and older had an average
   age of 48.0 years. In comparison, the transgender population had an
   average age of 39.4 years, while the non-binary population had an
   average age of 30.4 years.

   Transgender men (34.9 years) were almost a decade younger on average
   than transgender women (43.3 years).

   Close to two-thirds (62.0%) of the 100,815 individuals who were
   transgender or non-binary were younger than 35.

   Gender diversity was highest among those aged 20 to 24,
   almost 1 in 100 (0.85%) of whom were transgender or non-binary. In
   comparison, 1 in 700 were transgender or non-binary among people
   aged 65 and older.

Diversity within gender diversity: Most common terms to describe non-binary
gender

   In this release, the term "non-binary" is used to describe all genders
   that are neither exclusively man nor woman, although individuals might
   self-identify with other terms.

   Gender is experienced in different ways. The 2021 Census asked people
   to describe their gender via a write-in response so that they could
   indicate what term was most relevant to them. Terminology related to
   gender diversity continues to evolve, and the ways to report gender
   will also continue to evolve. Statistics Canada thanks the Canadian
   population for contributing to this ongoing discussion.

   Over two-thirds (70.5%) of people aged 15 and older who provided
   answers to the write-in option used the term "non-binary" when
   specifying their gender.

   Together, over 1 in 6 non-binary people described their gender as
   "fluid" (7.3%), "agender" (5.1%) or "queer" (4.1%).

   Other responses included "gender neutral" (2.9%), "Two-Spirit" (2.2%),
   "neither man nor woman" (1.3%) and "gender-nonconforming" (1.1%).

   The term "Two-Spirit," which is specific to some Indigenous peoples of
   North America, was provided in greater proportion by non-binary people
   living in Western Canada, especially in Manitoba (4.8%) where a large
   Indigenous population (First Nations people, Métis and Inuit) resides.

Among provinces and territories, Nova Scotia, Yukon and British Columbia show
the highest proportions of transgender and non-binary individuals

   Although transgender and non-binary people lived in every province and
   territory in Canada, they were concentrated in certain areas.
   Almost 2 in 5 transgender or non-binary people (39.1%) called Ontario
   home in 2021 (39,450), and this corresponds to Ontario's share of
   Canada's population aged 15 and older (38.8%).

   Gender diversity varies by region. Provincially, almost 1 in 200 people
   living in Nova Scotia (0.48%) and British Columbia (0.44%) were
   transgender or non-binary, proportions above the national average
   of 0.33%. Although counts were lower, Yukon (0.47%) also had one of the
   highest proportions in Canada.

   Among the provinces, Quebec had the smallest proportions of transgender
   (0.14%) and non-binary (0.09%) people, followed by Saskatchewan (0.16%
   and 0.12%, respectively).

About 1 in 100 people aged 15 to 34 in Nova Scotia and British Columbia are
transgender or non-binary

   Gender diversity was more common among people aged 15 to 34 than those
   aged 35 and older. Approximately 1 in 150 people aged 15 to 34 in
   Canada were transgender or non-binary (0.69%), compared
   with 1 in 550 people aged 35 and older (0.18%).

   Nova Scotia (1.17%) and British Columbia (0.90%) had the largest
   proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 to 34 among
   provinces, while Quebec (0.52%) and Saskatchewan (0.59%) had the lowest
   proportions.

   Among people aged 15 to 34, about 1 in 500 (0.20%) in Canada were
   transgender men and 1 in 650 (0.15%) were transgender women. The
   largest proportions of transgender men aged 15 to 34 were found in Nova
   Scotia (0.33%), New Brunswick (0.26%), and Newfoundland and Labrador
   (0.26%), while Nova Scotia (0.21%), Newfoundland and Labrador (0.19%),
   and British Columbia (0.19%) had the largest proportions of transgender
   women.

   Moreover, approximately 1 in 300 (0.34%) people aged 15 to 34 in Canada
   were non-binary. The largest proportion of non-binary people
   aged 15 to 34 was in Nova Scotia, at 0.63%, followed by British
   Columbia (0.49%) and New Brunswick (0.39%). Quebec had the lowest
   proportion in this age group, at 0.25%.

The vast majority of non-binary individuals in Canada live in an urban setting

   Urban living was more popular among non-binary individuals than among
   transgender and cisgender individuals. In 2021, over 9 in 10 non-binary
   people aged 15 and older in Canada (92.5%) lived in an urban centre of
   over 100,000 people, also called a census metropolitan area (CMA), or a
   mid-sized urban centre of over 10,000 people called a census
   agglomeration. This proportion was higher than for the Canadian
   population as a whole (84.1%).

   Chart 5: Higher proportion of non-binary people in Canada living in
   urban areas than transgender and cisgender people

   Among all CMAs, the largest proportions of transgender and non-binary
   people aged 15 and older were found in Victoria (0.75%), Halifax
   (0.66%) and Fredericton (0.60%), on the west and the east coasts of
   Canada.

   A number of factors could explain the greater gender diversity in these
   urban centres. Victoria, Halifax and Fredericton experienced stronger
   population growth from 2016 to 2021 than the national average.
   Moreover, in 2021, Halifax (27.6%) and Fredericton (26.0%) had larger
   proportions of people aged 15 to 34 than the national average (25.0%).
   All three urban centres are home to several major colleges and
   universities, and, since students tend to be younger, this could
   explain the proportionally higher presence of transgender and
   non-binary people in these urban centres.

   The three large urban centres with the lowest levels of gender
   diversity were all found in Quebec: Drummondville (0.17%), Saguenay
   (0.17%) and Trois-Rivières (0.20%). The populations of these urban
   centres are generally older (Census in Brief: A portrait of Canada's
   growing population aged 85 and older from the 2021 Census) than those
   of other Canadian CMAs. Drummondville (22.4%), Saguenay (21.4%) and
   Trois-Rivières (22.5%) had smaller proportions of people
   aged 15 to 34 than the national average (25.0%).

Over half of non-binary people live in Canada's six largest urban centres

   For the majority of non-binary people in Canada aged 15 and older
   (52.7%), urban living meant residing in one of Canada's six largest
   urban centres: Toronto (15.3%), Montréal (11.0%), Vancouver (10.8%),
   Ottawa–Gatineau (5.6%), Edmonton (5.4%) and Calgary (4.5%).

   Just under half of transgender women (49.1%) and transgender men
   (47.0%) aged 15 and older lived in 1 of these 6 largest urban centres,
   proportions similar to those of cisgender women (47.9%) and cisgender
   men (47.3%) living in these CMAs.

   While Quebec had the lowest proportion of transgender and non-binary
   people among the provinces, almost three-quarters (71.5%) of the
   non-binary people and over half (54.7%) of the transgender people in
   Quebec lived in the CMA of Montréal. By way of comparison, half of all
   Quebec residents aged 15 and older lived in the Montréal CMA.

   The proportion of non-binary people in Quebec living in the Montréal
   CMA (71.5%) was higher than the comparable proportions observed in the
   large urban areas of Vancouver (home to 53.1% of non-binary people in
   British Columbia) and Toronto (home to 41.3% of non-binary people in
   Ontario).

Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary people live downtown

   Living in a downtown core was also more popular for non-binary people
   than for transgender and cisgender people. Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary
   people aged 15 and older in Canada (15.5%) were living in the downtown
   of one of the country's 41 CMAs, and 7.3% lived in the downtown of 1 of
   the 6 largest CMAs. The proportion of non-binary individuals living in
   one of the CMA downtowns was over twice that of transgender (7.0%) and
   cisgender (4.7%) individuals.

   In Canada, approximately 1 in 200 people aged 15 and older living in a
   CMA downtown were non-binary (0.45%). Comparatively, 1 in 350 people
   were transgender men (0.13%) or transgender women (0.16%).

   Fredericton (1.8%), Nanaimo (1.5%) and Halifax (1.5%) had the largest
   proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 and older
   living downtown.

   Several factors could explain the larger share of non-binary people
   living in downtown cores. First, over one-third of individuals living
   in a CMA downtown were aged 15 to 34 (37.4%), and gender diversity was
   more common among people in this age group than among older people.
   Second, the concentration of numerous postsecondary educational
   institutions within downtown cores, combined with a more cosmopolitan
   atmosphere and the greater availability of social spaces and
   specialized services for transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people
   more broadly, may also explain the higher presence of non-binary people
   in the heart of large urban centres.

Transgender or non-binary populations have reported poorer mental health
outcomes

   Starting in 2018, Statistics Canada began introducing the new question
   on gender and the modified question on sex at birth on most health and
   social surveys.

   The 2018 Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces was the first
   large-scale household survey conducted by Statistics Canada to collect
   information about sex at birth and gender of respondents. It found
   that 1 in 400 people in Canada aged 15 and older were transgender or
   non-binary (0.24%).

   The survey also revealed important differences in victimization,
   discrimination and mental health by the gender diversity status of
   respondents. For example, almost two-thirds of transgender and
   non-binary individuals (65%) reported poor or fair mental health, five
   times the proportion of those who were cisgender (11%). Transgender and
   non-binary people were also more likely to have seriously contemplated
   suicide in their lifetimes than those who were cisgender (45%
   versus 16%).

   The 2019 Survey of Postsecondary Faculty and Researchers, conducted
   among university and college faculty, postdoctoral fellows and PhD
   students, found that 1.2% of postdoctoral fellows were non-binary, as
   were 0.7% of PhD students. Approximately 0.2% of university and college
   faculty were non-binary.

   Among postsecondary faculty and researchers in 2019, just
   over 1 in 10 men (11%) experienced unfair treatment or discrimination,
   compared with 20% of women and 41% of non-binary people.

   A socioeconomic analysis of the LGBTQ2+ population suggests transgender
   and non-binary populations may not have had the resources to cope with
   unexpected financial stress. According to the 2018 Canadian Housing
   Survey, non-binary individuals were more likely to live in a dwelling
   requiring major repairs (29%) than men or women (7%).

   In 2019, Trans PULSE Canada conducted a national community-based survey
   on the health and well-being of close to 3,000 transgender and
   non-binary people aged 14 and older, of whom around 800 respondents
   participated in a COVID-19 survey the following year. Results show that
   transgender and non-binary participants, who experienced greater levels
   of economic insecurity and social marginalization before the pandemic,
   may have been particularly affected. They found that a majority of
   transgender and non-binary people experienced both negative financial
   and social impacts from the pandemic.

   Using crowdsourced data collection, Statistics Canada found important
   gender differences in the self-perceived mental health of individuals
   in Canada during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. About
   two-thirds (68%) of non-binary participants reported fair or poor
   mental health, compared with just over one-quarter (26%) of women and
   just over one-fifth (21%) of men who participated in the crowdsource
   initiative.

Looking ahead

   The 2021 Census release on families, households and marital status,
   which will take place on July 13, 2022, will include analysis and data
   tables on couples. In particular, there will be analysis of same-gender
   and different-gender couples, as well as couples composed of at least
   one transgender person or at least one non-binary person.

   Family and household characteristics and sociocultural and
   socioeconomic data from the 2021 Census released over the next months
   will continue to enrich the portrait of the transgender and non-binary
   populations in Canada.

Definitions, concepts and geography

   In April 2018, Statistics Canada published new metadata standards for
   sex at birth and gender to better reflect the way the Canadian
   population self-identifies. Throughout the winter of 2021, Statistics
   Canada held a public consultation on the update to the gender standard
   to ensure it remains relevant and meaningful for the communities of
   interest.

   The standards on sex at birth and gender were modified to reflect
   feedback received during this consultation. The updated standards were
   published in October 2021, and a "What we heard" report summarizing
   comments received during the public consultation will be published in
   the coming months.

   The sex at birth standard provides a classification variant with three
   categories (male, female and intersex). However, for reasons related to
   the small size of the intersex population and the challenges in
   identifying intersex people, Statistics Canada does not currently
   collect specific information on intersex people in Canada.

   Tables 1 and 2 present distributions of the Canadian population
   aged 15 and older living in a private household by sex according to
   data from the 1991 to 2016 censuses and sex at birth and gender
   using 2021 Census data.

   In 2021, the number of people whose sex was male was very similar to
   the number of men. The same was observed among people whose sex was
   female compared with women. These similarities can be explained by the
   relatively small size of the transgender and non-binary populations.
   Moreover, the distribution of the population aged 15 and older in
   private households by sex (from 1991 to 2016) and sex at birth
   (in 2021) was very similar between census years.

   In this article, certain gender non-binary terms were grouped based on
   their similarities (e.g., "genderqueer," "queer man" and "queer woman"
   are all included in the estimate of "queer"). For more information on
   collection and processing methods of responses to the "specify" option
   for the gender question, please refer to the Age, Sex at Birth and
   Gender Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021.

   The term "Two-Spirit" is specific to some Indigenous peoples of North
   America (see gender classification). However, the Indigenous identity
   of individuals was not taken into account when coding answers to the
   "specify" option for the gender question. The number of "Two-Spirit"
   answers may be smaller if only Indigenous individuals were included.

   The definitions for terms describing non-binary gender are included in
   the Gender and Sexual Diversity Glossary, published by the Translation
   Bureau.

   In this release, the analysis of gender diversity results is limited to
   the population aged 15 and older even though the question was asked
   regardless of age, as children aged 14 and younger may not be fully
   aware of their gender identity or may not have defined it yet.

   In the Census in brief: A generational portrait of Canada's aging
   population from the 2021 Census, Generation Z is defined as people born
   between 1997 and 2012 and aged 9 to 24 in May 2021. In this article,
   since the analysis is focused on the population aged 15 and older,
   Generation Z is redefined as those born between 1997 and 2006 and
   aged 15 to 24 in May 2021.

   To ensure the confidentiality of responses collected for
   the 2021 Census, a random rounding process is used to alter the values
   of released data. As a result, when these data are summed or grouped,
   the total value may not match the sum of the individual values, since
   the total and subtotals are independently rounded. Similarly,
   percentage distributions, which are calculated on rounded data, may not
   necessarily add up to 100%.
