Transgender/ Non Binary / Gender Nonconforming Passengers

   TSA recognizes the concerns that some members of the transgender/non
   binary/gender nonconforming traveling public have with screening
   technology and certain security screening procedures at the nation’s
   security checkpoints. TSA is committed to ensuring all travelers are
   treated with respect and dignity. Screening is conducted without regard
   to a person's race, color, sex, gender, gender identity, national
   origin, religion, or disability.

Prior to the Airport

TSA Precheck® Enhancements

   The TSA PreCheck program application has been updated to include an
   additional gender marker option to better serve non-binary and gender
   non-conforming Americans.  This action will ensure the TSA PreCheck
   system accurately reflects the traveler’s gender. With this update, TSA
   allows TSA PreCheck applicants to select their gender based on
   self-attestation, regardless of the sex assigned at birth. If you are a
   member of the TSA PreCheck Application Program, you may call (855)
   347-8371 weekdays, between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. EDT, to request a gender
   data update.  You may also submit your inquiry online.

   This new gender marker option will not impact the security screening
   process. Security screening is conducted without discrimination against
   travelers based on their race, color, sex, gender, gender identity,
   national origin, religion or disability.

   Updating of a traveler’s gender on other identification documents is
   not required to enroll in TSA PreCheck screening. Travelers will
   receive TSA PreCheck security screening even if their current gender
   differs from the gender provided when they enrolled in TSA PreCheck, as
   long as the name, known traveler number (KTN) and date of birth on
   their reservation matches their record with TSA. FAQs can be found at
   the TSA PreCheck Frequently Asked Questions.

Making Your Air Travel Reservations

   When making a reservation, please use the same name and date of birth
   indicated on your government-issued ID. We also encourage you to
   provide the gender indicated on your government-issued ID. TSA
   recommends that travelers contact air carrier customer service if the
   gender marker on their government-issued ID is not offered in the air
   carrier’s reservation system. TSA continues to work closely with our
   domestic air-carrier partners to promote the use and acceptance of the
   “X” gender marker.” Currently, two major domestic air carriers already
   offer “X” or undisclosed gender options in their travel-reservation
   systems, with a third air carrier offering the same in the fall of
   2022.  Read additional information about identification.

Contacting TSA in Advance

   Prior to a flight, you may contact the TSA Cares helpline at (855)
   787-2227 with questions about screening policies and procedures, as
   well as what to expect as you proceed through the security checkpoint.
   You may request the assistance of a Passenger Support Specialist, who
   will provide assistance through the security screening process.

While at the Airport

Travel Document Checker

   At the checkpoint, present your government-issued identification and
   boarding pass to the TSA officer who will ensure the identification and
   boarding pass are authentic and that the name shown on each document is
   exactly the same. If the name shown on the identification document does
   not exactly match the name on the boarding pass, you may need to go to
   your airline ticket counter for a new boarding pass.

   TSA has updated its checkpoint procedures to remove gender
   considerations when validating a traveler’s identification at airport
   security checkpoints. When travelers appear at the travel-document
   checker podium for identity verification, gender information is not
   considered. Go to Security Screening Identification for more
   information.

Inform the TSA Officer

   All baggage – both checked baggage and carry-on baggage – must go
   through the screening process. For carry-on baggage - inform the TSA
   officer if you have medically necessary liquids and/or medications,
   medical equipment, and/or prostheses, and separate them from other
   belongings before screening begins. If a bag must be opened by an
   officer to resolve an alarm, you may ask that the bag be opened and
   inspected in private.

Physical Screening Procedures

   Passenger screening at the airport is part of TSA’s layered approach to
   security to get you safely to your destination. Read about
   various screening measures in place to secure aviation.

   You will be screened by Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), a
   walk-through metal detector (WTMD), and/or a pat-down procedure.

   The AIT Screening Process:

   Currently, TSA’s AIT units utilize software that relies on
   gender-specific algorithms and a generic physical outline of the human
   body that is identical for all passengers. When you enter the imaging
   portal, the TSA officer will press a button designating your gender as
   male or female based on the TSA officer’s assessment of how you
   present. The equipment then conducts a scan and indicates areas on the
   body warranting further screening, if necessary.

   If there is an alarm, a TSA officer may show you, on a screen, where
   the alarm is present. Additional screening, including a pat-down
   procedure, may be conducted to determine whether a prohibited item is
   present.

   AIT Technology Enhancements and Updated Screening Procedures:

   TSA identified an opportunity to enhance our existing AIT security
   effectiveness capabilities and simultaneously implement a
   gender-neutral algorithm.  In coordination with the system
   manufacturer, TSA is in the process of testing this new algorithm. This
   change will benefit all travelers, including transgender, nonbinary,
   and other gender-nonconforming travelers who previously have been
   required to undergo additional screening due to alarms in sensitive
   areas.  Upon completion of successful testing, TSA anticipates
   initiating deployment of the technology enhancement to airports later
   this year.

   Beginning in May 2022, TSA is also updating its screening procedures to
   better serve transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming travelers
   through less invasive screening procedures for passengers who trigger
   the AIT scanner in a sensitive area. This change will reduce the number
   of pat downs for TSOs and the travelling public without compromising
   security, and will be in effect until the gender-neutral AIT screening
   technology is deployed.

   You may ask for a supervisor at any point during the AIT screening
   process.

   Pat-Downs: If there is a screening alarm by technology (i.e., AIT,
   WTMD), or if you opt-out of screening by technology, a pat-down
   procedure is performed, and is generally conducted by an officer that
   is the same gender as the TSA officer’s assessment of how you present.
   Alternatively, you may choose to inform the officer of your gender
   identity and make a request that the pat-down be conducted by an
   officer of that gender.

   Screening can be conducted in the checkpoint area, or you may request
   to have a pat-down in private and be accompanied by a companion of your
   choice. You may bring your carry-on baggage to the private screening
   area and may request a chair to sit if needed. You will not be asked to
   remove or lift any article of clothing to reveal sensitive body areas.
   You may be asked to adjust loose fitting clothing by the TSA officer
   doing the pat-down procedure. For additional information about the
   pat-down, see Security Screening. Please also see additional guidance
   for on body prostheses.

Contact Us

   If you have experienced an inappropriate screening process at a
   security checkpoint, you may request to speak with a supervisor at the
   checkpoint. You may also submit your concern to the TSA Contact Center.

   If you have experienced discrimination, you may email or submit a civil
   rights complaint.
