Transgender-Specific Issues

--

   A growing number of non-transgender individuals are breaking
   traditional gender norms. Male goth youth, for example, wear eyeliner

   Transgender people may decide to consistently present as male or female
   in alignment with societal norms. They may also deliberately choose

   Some transgender people express gender in very traditional or overt
   ways to better "pass" as the gender with which they identify. For
   example, a male-to-female (MTF) transgender person may always wear
   skirts and stereotypically feminine blouses, paired with matching
--
   Body image can play a role in how people express their gender.
   Transgender people generally have an even more uncomfortable or
   negative relationship with their bodies than non-transgender people.
   Some create a literal armor to hide or alter their bodies or to create

   Some transgender peoplebut by no means alluse hormones as part of
   their medical transition. According to the National Center for
   Transgender Equality's (NCTE) groundbreaking study of 6,450 transgender
   individuals, 62 percent of respondents have had some hormone therapy

   Because some of the changes from hormone use are permanent, some
   transgender people stop using hormones once they have achieved specific
   physical goals. Others stop for health reasons or because they become

   physical wellness. Many providers adhere to a standard of care to guide
   their treatment of transgender patients, which requires that a mental
   health professional also be involved.^15 Most standards of care require
   that transgender clients participate in therapy for a time, typically 3
   months to 1 year, after which the mental health care provider will

   treatment. This "gatekeeping" model can create additional challenges.
   For example, transgender people who visit mental health professionals
   may omit certain details about their lives out of fear that they will

   providers, however, are moving from standards of care to informed
   consent models of care, giving both transgender patients and providers
   more flexibility, autonomy, and control over the health care

   Non-transgender people frequently believe there is one "transgender
   surgery," which involves the genitals. The reality is that there is no

   their gender identity. As with hormone use, health care providers
   operating under standards of care may require their transgender clients
   to participate in therapy before surgery. In fact, surgeons

   The following data on surgeries were taken from the National
   Transgender Discrimination Survey conducted in 2011^17:

       percent), and/or removal of the testes (21 percent). Because of the
       danger of attracting anti-transgender violence in public, some
       transgender women consider breast augmentation and facial
       feminization surgeries higher priorities than genital surgery.

   Cutting, or non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as a way of coping with
   abuse and stress is common among transgender people. In a study of 977
   individuals, almost 42 percent had a history of NSSI, as compared to
   4–38 percent in the non-transgender population. FTMs had substantially
   higher rates of NSSI. Of transgender people who were prevented from
   transitioning (denied letters for hormones or surgery), 50 percent had

   On rare occasions, some transgender people who have been unable to
   access surgeries due to cost and/or surgeons' refusals to operate have

   Contrary to popular belief, many transgender people do not feel the
   need to surgically alter their bodies. For that reason, combined with
   prohibitive costs, lack of access, and worries about functionality and
   aesthetics, FORGE believes that most transgender people do not have
   gender-related surgery. This underlying belief is supported by the
   National Transgender Discrimination Survey's broad sample of
   transgender individuals and their experiences and desires with/for
   surgery.^19
