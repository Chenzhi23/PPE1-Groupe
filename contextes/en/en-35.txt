   Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
   March 31, 2023, as Transgender Day of Visibility.  I call upon all
   Americans to join us in lifting up the lives and voices of transgender
   people throughout our Nation and to work toward eliminating violence
   and discrimination against all transgender, gender nonconforming, and
   nonbinary people.
