The Bottom Line

   The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community has seen
   both significant progress and painful setbacks recently. The 2015
   Supreme Court ruling in favor of the freedom to marry was a major step
   toward legal equality, and there have been many successes since then at
   the federal, state, and local levels, including increased protections
   for transgender and gender non-conforming people. However, since the
   ruling, there have also been more than 200 anti-LGBT bills introduced

   To help make sense of the current policy landscape in the states for
   LGBT people, and transgender people specifically, Mapping Transgender

   lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. That said, transgender people who
   are lesbian, gay or bisexual can be affected by laws that explicitly
   mention sexual orientation.

   mannerisms and speech patterns that can be described as masculine,
   feminine, or something else. Gender identity and expression are
   independent of sexual orientation, and transgender people may identify
   as heterosexual, lesbian, gay or bisexual. Laws that explicitly mention
   "gender identity" or "gender identity and expression" primarily protect
   or harm transgender people. These laws also can apply to people who are
   not transgender, but whose sense of gender or manner of dress does not
   adhere to gender stereotypes.
