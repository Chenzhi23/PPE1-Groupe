   transgender, term self-applied by persons whose gender identity varies
   from that traditionally associated with their apparent biological sex
   at birth. In its original and narrower sense, transgender referred to
   males and females who respectively gender-identify as females and
   males. In a later and broader sense, it has come to designate persons
   whose gender identities incorporate behaviours and traits traditionally
   associated with the opposite sex. Transgender persons may thus include
   transsexuals, transgenderists (in one usage of the term, persons who
   gender-identify with the opposite sex but who choose not to undergo
   sex-reassignment surgery or hormone treatments), and androgynes
   (biologically or psychologically androgynous persons), among other
   groups. In its broader sense, transgender is closely related to the
   more-recent term genderqueer, which is self-applied by persons who are
   either transgender or who have no gender, a third (neither male nor
   female) gender, or a fluctuating gender.

   United States, based on the broad definition used in this article, have
   varied from less than 1 percent to more than 3 percent of the

Sex, gender, and sexual orientation

   The notion of transgender presupposes fundamental distinctions between
   the concepts of sex, gender, and sexual orientation (see human sexual
   behaviour). Whereas sex is a biological category, gender refers to the
   set of traits and behaviours that are traditionally associated with a
   particular sex. A person who is transgender experiences and expresses a
   disjunction between sex and gender. Sexual orientation, in contrast, is
   defined in terms of the sexes or genders to which a person is sexually,
   emotionally, or romantically attracted. It is a widespread but mistaken
   assumption that transgender persons are necessarily homosexual (i.e.,
   attracted to members of the sex that they were assigned at birth).
   Although some are homosexual, others are heterosexual or bisexual or do

   Various theories of gender have been proposed as explanations of the
   experience of transgender persons. In addition to the concepts of sex
   and gender, those of gender identity and gender expression are
   particularly important for such theories. Gender identity refers to a
