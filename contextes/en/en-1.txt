   A transgender person (often shortened to trans) is someone whose gender
   identity differs from that typically associated with the sex they were
   assigned at birth.^[1] Some transgender people who desire medical
   assistance to transition from one sex to another identify as
   transsexual.^[2]^[3] Transgender, often shortened as trans, is also an
--
   the opposite of their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may
   also include people who are non-binary or genderqueer.^[4]^[5]^[6]
   Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a
   third gender, or else conceptualize transgender people as a third
   gender.^[7]^[8] The term may also include cross-dressers or drag kings
   and drag queens in some contexts.^[9] The term transgender does not
   have a universally accepted definition, including among
   researchers.^[10] ^[11]

   Being transgender is distinct from sexual orientation, and transgender
   people may identify as heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay or
   lesbian), bisexual, asexual, or otherwise, or may decline to label
   their sexual orientation.^[12] The opposite of transgender is
   cisgender, which describes persons whose gender identity matches their
   assigned sex.^[13] Accurate statistics on the number of transgender
   people vary widely,^[14] in part due to different definitions of what
   constitutes being transgender.^[10] Some countries, such as Canada,
   collect census data on transgender people.^[15] Generally, fewer than
   1% of the worldwide population are transgender, with figures ranging
   from <0.1% to 0.6%.^[16]^[17]^[18]

   Many transgender people experience gender dysphoria, and some seek
   medical treatments such as hormone replacement therapy,
   gender-affirming surgery, or psychotherapy.^[19] Not all transgender
   people desire these treatments, and some cannot undergo them for
   financial or medical reasons.^[19]^[20]

   The legal status of transgender people varies by jurisdiction. Many
   transgender people experience transphobia, or violence or
   discrimination towards transgender people, in the workplace,^[21] in
   accessing public accommodations,^[22] and in healthcare.^[23] In many
   places, they are not legally protected from discrimination.^[24]
   Several cultural events are held to celebrate the awareness of
   transgender people, including Transgender Day of Remembrance and
   International Transgender Day of Visibility,^[25]^[26] and the
   transgender flag is a common transgender pride symbol.^[27]

   Before the mid-20th century various terms were used within and beyond
   Western medical and psychological sciences to identify persons and
   identities labeled transsexual, and later transgender from mid-century
   onward.^[5]^[30] Imported from the German and ultimately modeled after
   German Transsexualismus (coined in 1923),^[31] the English term
   transsexual has enjoyed international acceptability, though transgender
   has been increasingly preferred over transsexual.^[32] The word
   transgender acquired its modern umbrella term meaning in the
   1990s.^[33]^[34]

--

   Psychiatrist John F. Oliven of Columbia University used the term
   transgenderism in his 1965 reference work Sexual Hygiene and
   Pathology,^[35]^[36]^[37] writing that the term which had previously
   been used, transsexualism, "is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism'
   is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary
   transvestism."^[38]^[39] The term transgender was then popularized with
   varying definitions by various transgender, transsexual, and
   transvestite people, including Virginia Prince,^[2] who used
   transgenderal^[40] in the December 1969 issue of Transvestia, a
   national magazine for cross-dressers she founded.^[41] By the mid-1970s
   both trans-gender and trans people were in use as umbrella terms,^[note
   1] while transgenderist and transgenderal were used to refer to people
   who wanted to live their lives as cross-gendered individuals without
   sex reassignment surgery (SRS).^[42] By 1976, transgenderist was
   abbreviated as TG in educational materials.^[43]^[verification needed]

   By 1984, the concept of a "transgender community" had developed, in
   which transgender was used as an umbrella term.^[44] In 1985, Richard
   Elkins established the "Trans-Gender Archive" at the University of
   Ulster.^[41] By 1992, the International Conference on Transgender Law
   and Employment Policy defined transgender as an expansive umbrella term
   including "transsexuals, transgenderists, cross dressers", and anyone
   transitioning.^[45] Leslie Feinberg's pamphlet, "Transgender
   Liberation: A Movement Whose Time has Come", circulated in 1992,
   identified transgender as a term to unify all forms of gender
   nonconformity; in this way transgender has become synonymous with
   queer.^[46] In 1994, gender theorist Susan Stryker defined transgender
   as encompassing "all identities or practices that cross over, cut
   across, move between, or otherwise queer socially constructed
--

   Between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s, the primary terms used under
   the transgender umbrella were "female to male" (FtM) for men who
   transitioned from female to male, and "male to female" (MtF) for women
   who transitioned from male to female. These terms have been superseded
--
   preference from terms highlighting biological sex ("transsexual",
   "FtM") to terms highlighting gender identity and expression
   ("transgender", "trans man") reflects a broader shift in the
   understanding of transgender people's sense of self and the increasing
   recognition of those who decline medical reassignment as part of the
   transgender community.^[48]

   Transgender can also refer specifically to a person whose gender
--

   Transgendered is a common term in older literature. Many within the
   transgender community deprecate it on the basis that transgender is an
   adjective, not a verb.^[54] Organizations such as GLAAD and The
   Guardian also state that transgender should never be used as a noun
   (e.g., "Max is transgender" or "Max is a transgender man", not "Max is
   a transgender").^[5]^[55] "Transgender" is also a noun for the broader
   topic of transgender identity and experience.^[56]

   Although the term "transgenderism" was once considered acceptable, it
   has come to be viewed as offensive, according to GLAAD.^[57] In 2020
   the International Journal of Transgenderism changed its name to the
--
   and LGBT advocacy groups advise the adoption by others of the name and
   pronouns identified by the person in question, including present
   references to the transgender person's past.^[59]^[60]

   In contrast, people whose sense of personal identity corresponds to the
   sex and gender assigned to them at birth - that is, those who are
   neither transgender nor non-binary or genderqueer - are called
   cisgender.^[61]

--
   the term transsexual was introduced to English in 1949 by David Oliver
   Cauldwell^[note 2] and popularized by Harry Benjamin in 1966, around
   the same time transgender was coined and began to be popularized.^[2]
   Since the 1990s, transsexual has generally been used to refer to the
   subset of transgender people^[2]^[62]^[63] who desire to transition
   permanently to the gender with which they identify and who seek medical
   assistance (for example, sex reassignment surgery) with this.

   Distinctions between the terms transgender and transsexual are commonly
   based on distinctions between gender and sex.^[64]^[65] Transsexuality
   may be said to deal more with physical aspects of one's sex, while
   transgender considerations deal more with one's psychological gender
   disposition or predisposition, as well as the related social
   expectations that may accompany a given gender role.^[66] Many
   transgender people reject the term transsexual.^[3]^[67]^[5] Christine
   Jorgensen publicly rejected transsexual in 1979 and instead identified
   herself in newsprint as trans-gender, saying, "gender doesn't have to

   condition related to gender identity rather than
   sexuality.^[70]^[better source needed]^[note 3]^[failed verification]
   Some transsexual people object to being included in the transgender
   umbrella.^[71]^[72]^[73]

   In his 2007 book Imagining Transgender: An Ethnography of a Category,
   anthropologist David Valentine asserts that transgender was coined and
   used by activists to include many people who do not necessarily
   identify with the term and states that people who do not identify with
   the term transgender should not be included in the transgender
   spectrum.^[71] Leslie Feinberg likewise asserts that transgender is not
   a self-identifier (for some people) but a category imposed by observers
   to understand other people.^[72] According to the Transgender Health

   For much of the 20th century, transgender identity was conflated with

   literature, sexologists used the labels homosexual and heterosexual

   and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Drag performers are
   not inherently transgender. Some drag performers, transvestites, and
   people in the gay community have embraced the pornographically derived
   term tranny for drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or
   cross-dressing; this term is widely considered an offensive slur if
   applied to transgender people.

History

   Main articles: Transgender history and Third gender

   A precise history of the global occurrence of transgender people is
   difficult to assess because the modern concept of being transgender,
   and of gender in general in relation to transgender identity, did not
   develop until the mid-1900s. Historical depictions, records and
   understandings are inherently filtered through modern principles, and

   Some historians consider the Roman emperor Elagabalus to have been

   manner, preferred to be called "Lady" instead of "Lord" and may have
   even sought a primitive form of gender-affirming

   disease" as natural variation, but by the 1700s writers viewed it as a
   "melancholy", or "hysterical" psychiatric disease. By the early 1800s,
   being transgender separate from Hippocrates' idea of it was claimed to
   be widely known, but remained poorly documented. Both trans women and
   trans men were cited in European insane asylums of the early 1800s. One
   of the earliest recorded transgender people in America was Thomas(ine)
   Hall, a seventeenth century colonial servant.^[116] The most complete
   account of the time came from the life of the Chevalier d'Éon
   (1728-1810), a French diplomat. As cross-dressing became more
   widespread in the late 1800s, discussion of transgender people
   increased greatly and writers attempted to explain the origins of being
   transgender. Much study came out of Germany, and was exported to other
   Western audiences. Cross-dressing was seen in a pragmatic light until
   the late 1800s; it had previously served a satirical or disguising
   purpose. But in the latter half of the 1800s, cross-dressing and being
   transgender became viewed as an increasing societal danger.^[108]

   William A. Hammond wrote an 1882 account of transgender Pueblo
   "shamans" [sic] (mujerados), comparing them to the Scythian disease.
   Other writers of the late 1700s and 1800s (including Hammond's
   associates in the American Neurological Association) had noted the
   widespread nature of transgender cultural practices among native
   peoples. Explanations varied, but authors generally did not ascribe
   native transgender practices to psychiatric causes, instead condemning
   the practices in a religious and moral sense. Native groups provided
   much study on the subject, and perhaps the majority of all study until

   Critical studies first began to emerge in the late 1800s in Germany,
   with the works of Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfeld coined the term
   "transvestite" in 1910 as the scope of transgender study grew. His work
   would lead to the 1919 founding of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft
   in Berlin. Though Hirscheld's legacy is disputed, he revolutionized the

   2017, the Danish parliament abolished the F64 Gender identity
   disorders. The DSM-5 refers to the topic as gender dysphoria (GD) while
   reinforcing the idea that being transgender is not considered a mental
   illness.^[125]

   Transgender people may meet the criteria for a diagnosis of gender
   dysphoria "only if [being transgender] causes distress or
   disability."^[126] This distress may manifest as depression or
   inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This
   diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that all transgender
   people suffer from GD, which has confused transgender people and those
   who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are
   comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing

   Clinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to
   adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of
   practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this
   population of individuals.^[127] Many mental healthcare providers know
   little about transgender issues. Those who seek help from these
   professionals often educate the professional without receiving
   help.^[120] This solution usually is good for transsexual people but is
   not the solution for other transgender people, particularly non-binary
   people who lack an exclusively male or female identity. Instead,
   therapists can support their clients in whatever steps they choose to
--
   identity and appearance.^[128]

   Research on the specific problems faced by the transgender community in
   mental health has focused on diagnosis and clinicians' experiences
   instead of transgender clients' experiences.^[129] Therapy was not
   always sought by transgender people due to mental health needs. Prior
   to the seventh version of the Standards of Care (SOC), an individual
   had to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder in order to proceed
--
   decreased the focus on diagnosis and instead emphasized the importance
   of flexibility in order to meet the diverse health care needs of
   transsexual, transgender, and all gender-nonconforming people.^[130]

   The reasons for seeking mental health services vary according to the
   individual. A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily
   mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of
   dealing with stigma and experiencing transphobia pushes many
   transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life,
   as one trans woman reflected: "Transgendered individuals are going to
   come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do,
   specifically, with being transgendered. It has to do because they've
   had to hide, they've had to lie, and they've felt all of this guilt and
   shame, unfortunately usually for years!"^[129] Many transgender people
   also seek mental health treatment for depression and anxiety caused by
   the stigma attached to being transgender, and some transgender people
   have stressed the importance of acknowledging their gender identity
   with a therapist in order to discuss other quality-of-life
   issues.^[129] Rarely, some choose to detransition.^[131]

   Problems still remain surrounding misinformation about transgender
   issues that hurt transgender people's mental health experiences. One
   trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate
   program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training:
   "Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe
   that's it. I don't think I've had any formal training just going
   through [clinical] programs ... I don't think most [therapists] know.

   associated with gender transition, and numerous people are under- or
   uninsured, which raises concerns about the insufficient training most
   therapists receive prior to working with transgender clients,
   potentially increasing financial strain on clients without providing
   the treatment they need.^[129] Many clinicians who work with
   transgender clients only receive mediocre training on gender identity,
   but introductory training on interacting with transgender people has
   recently been made available to health care professionals to help
   remove barriers and increase the level of service for the transgender
   population.^[132] In February 2010, France became the first country in
   the world to remove transgender identity from the list of mental
   diseases.^[133]^[134]

   A 2014 study carried out by the Williams Institute (a UCLA think tank)
   found that 41% of transgender people had attempted suicide, with the
   rate being higher among people who experienced discrimination in access
   to housing or healthcare, harassment, physical or sexual assault, or
   rejection by family.^[135] A 2019 follow-up study found that
   transgender people who wanted and received gender-affirming medical
   care had substantially lower rates of suicidal thoughts and

  Feminism

   Main articles: Feminist views on transgender topics and Transfeminism

   Feminist views on transgender women have changed over time, but have
   generally become more positive. Second-wave feminism saw numerous
   clashes opposed to transgender women, since they were not seen as
   "true" women, and as invading women-only spaces.^[184]^[185] Though
   second-wave feminism argued for the sex and gender distinction, some
   feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity
   and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female
   transition abandoned or devalued female identity and that transgender
   people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes.^[186] By the
   emergence of third-wave feminism (around 1990), opinions had shifted to

   form of harassment or mistreatment in their workplace. Moreover, 47%
   have experienced some form of adverse employment outcome due to being

   advocacy efforts, the NCTE works to address issues such as healthcare
   access, employment discrimination, and legal recognition for
   transgender individuals.^[200] One prominent organization within Europe
   is Transgender Europe (TGEU), a network of organizations and
   individuals committed to promoting equality and human rights for

Population figures and prevalence

   Little is known about the prevalence of transgender people in the
   general population and reported prevalence estimates are greatly
   affected by variable definitions of transgender.^[202] According to a

   of using consistent terminology related to studying the experience of

   ("intergender/androgynes"), or the presence of both masculine and
   feminine identities in a single person ("bigender"). They are framed as
   something entirely separate from transgender women, who possess the
   same gender identity of people assigned female at birth.^[241]

   Other transgender identities are becoming more widely known, as a
   result of contact with other cultures of the Western world.^[242] These
   newer identities, sometimes known under the umbrella use of the term
   "genderqueer",^[242] along with the older travesti term, are known as
   non-binary and go along with binary transgender identities (those
   traditionally diagnosed under the obsolete label of "transsexualism")
   under the single umbrella of transgender, but are distinguished from
   cross-dressers and drag queens and kings, that are held as
   nonconforming gender expressions rather than transgender gender
   identities when a distinction is made.^[243]

   Transgender people vary greatly in choosing when, whether, and how to
   disclose their transgender status to family, close friends, and others.
   The prevalence of discrimination and violence against transgender
   persons can make coming out a risky decision. Fear of retaliatory
   behavior, such as being removed from the parental home while underage,
   is a cause for transgender people to not come out to their families
   until they have reached adulthood.^[citation needed] Parental confusion
   and lack of acceptance of a transgender child may result in parents
   treating a newly revealed gender identity as a "phase" or making
   efforts to change their children back to "normal" by utilizing mental

   The internet can play a significant role in the coming out process for
   transgender people. Some come out in an online identity first,
   providing an opportunity to go through experiences virtually and safely
   before risking social sanctions in the real world.^[245]
