   TransAmsterdam is a trans organization for art, culture, and lifestyle.
   Our goal is to increase the visibility of transgender, including
   non-binary, people and improve their image through art and culture. Are
   you an artist and do you want to share or develop your talents? Or
   would you like to meet other people in and surrounding the transgender
   community? Then TransAmsterdam is the organization for you!

--
   With art and culture, we aim to show that trans people are more than
   their gender. By doing so, we connect the trans community to the rest
   of society and increase the emancipation and empowerment of transgender
   people in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and beyond.
