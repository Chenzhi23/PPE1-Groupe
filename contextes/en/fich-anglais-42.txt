What Is Transgender?

   Diverse gender identities fall under the transgender umbrella
   By Elizabeth Boskey, PhD
--

   Transgender is a term used to describe people whose gender identity
   does not conform with the gender they were assigned at birth. A person
   designated male at birth who identifies as female is a transgender
   woman, while a person designated female at birth who identifies as male
   is a transgender man.

   In recent years, transgender has become an umbrella term that includes
   not only people who are binary (male or female) but also those who are

   of gender with one's inward sense of gender, is central to the
   transgender identity. Medical treatments or surgery may be involved,
   but not always.

   This article explains what it means to be transgender, including the
   terminology used and how to use it correctly. It also describes the
   process of gender affirmation and some of the serious challenges faced
   by transgender people today.

What It Means to Be Transgender

   Transgender traditionally means to identify as male if you were
   assigned female at birth or to identify as female if you were assigned
   male at birth. And, to many, that remains the definition of
   "transgender," described on the male-female binary.

   In the current vernacular, non-binary people may fall under the
   "transgender umbrella" when they consciously move away from expected
   gender roles and align themselves, their presentation, and sometimes
--
   Whether binary or non-binary, the one characteristic that connects all
   transgender people is that the gender assigned to them at birth does
   not match their own internal sense of gender identity.

   This mismatch can be felt from as early as three to five years in some
   transgender children. Others may not recognize it until puberty when
   changes in their bodies create a palpable sense of unease about their

Do All Transgender People Have Surgery?

   Despite what many people think, a person does not have to undergo
   medical treatments to be transgender. Social and/or legal affirmation
   may be far more important to some people.

   While many transgender people will take hormones to align their
   physical expression with their gender identity, there are many who

   Transgender is an adjective (as in "he is a transgender man"). It is
   not used as a noun (such as "he is a transgender")" or a verb ("he is
   transgendered").

   "Trans" is often used as a shorthand for transgender, so it is usually
   acceptable to describe a transgender man as a trans man and a
   transgender woman as a trans woman.

   If someone identifies as transgender, you would typically use the
   pronouns "he" and "him" for a transgender man and "she" and "her" for a
   transgender woman. Even so, non-binary or gender-non-conforms people
   may prefer "them" and "they" or other pronouns, so ask first if you are

     * Gender-confirming: A transgender person does not need to confirm or
       "prove" their gender. A transgender person affirms their gender by
       asserting their authentic self. Gender-affirming surgery is
       preferred, for example, over gender-confirming surgery.
     * Gender reassignment: In the same vein, a transgender person's
       gender is not changed or reassigned. This is especially true if you

     * Sex change: This is an outdated and largely offensive term that
       suggests that being transgender is about changing one's genitals.
     * Transsexual: This is another outdated and offensive term that
       equates transgender identity with surgery, such as when describing
       a "pre-op transsexual" and "post-op transsexual."
     * Tranny, She-Male, or She-He: These are defamatory terms used to
       dehumanize transgender people.
     * Transgenderism: This is a term used by anti-trans activists that
       suggests that there is a movement to "recruit" or "push" people
       toward becoming transgender.
