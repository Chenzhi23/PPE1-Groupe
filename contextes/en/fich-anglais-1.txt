   A transgender person (often shortened to trans) is someone whose gender
   identity differs from that typically associated with the sex they were
   assigned at birth.^[1] Some transgender people who desire medical
   assistance to transition from one sex to another identify as
   transsexual.^[2]^[3] Transgender is an umbrella term; in addition to
   including people whose gender identity is the opposite of their
--
   who are non-binary or genderqueer.^[4]^[5]^[6] Other definitions of
   transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or else
   conceptualize transgender people as a third gender.^[7]^[8] The term
   transgender may be defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.^[9]

   Being transgender is distinct from sexual orientation.^[10] Transgender
   people may identify as heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay or
   lesbian), bisexual, asexual, or otherwise, or may decline to label
   their sexual orientation. The opposite of transgender is cisgender,
   which describes persons whose gender identity matches their assigned
   sex.^[11] Accurate statistics on the number of transgender people vary
   widely,^[12] in part due to different definitions of what constitutes
   being transgender.^[13] Some countries, such as Canada, collect census
   data on transgender people.^[14] Generally, fewer than 1% of the
   worldwide population are transgender, with figures ranging from <0.1%
   to 0.6%.^[15]^[16]^[17]

   Western medical and psychological sciences to identify persons and
   identities labeled transsexual, and later transgender from mid-century
   onward.^[5]^[27] Imported from the German and ultimately modeled after
   German Transsexualismus (coined in 1923),^[28] the English term
   transsexual has enjoyed international acceptability, though transgender
   has been increasingly preferred over transsexual.^[29] The word
   transgender acquired its modern umbrella term meaning in the
   1990s.^[30]^[31]

  Transgender

   Psychiatrist John F. Oliven of Columbia University used the term
   transgenderism in his 1965 reference work Sexual Hygiene and
   Pathology,^[32]^[33]^[34] writing that the term which had previously
   been used, transsexualism, "is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism'
   is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary
   transvestism."^[35]^[36] The term transgender was then popularized with
   varying definitions by various transgender, transsexual, and
   transvestite people, including Virginia Prince,^[2] who used
   transgenderal^[37] in the December 1969 issue of Transvestia, a
   national magazine for cross-dressers she founded.^[38] By the mid-1970s
   both trans-gender and trans people were in use as umbrella terms,^[note
   1] while transgenderist and transgenderal were used to refer to people
   who wanted to live cross-gender without sex reassignment surgery
   (SRS).^[39] By 1976, transgenderist was abbreviated as TG in
   educational materials.^[40]^[verification needed]

   By 1984, the concept of a "transgender community" had developed, in
   which transgender was used as an umbrella term.^[41] In 1985, Richard
   Elkins established the "Trans-Gender Archive" at the University of
   Ulster.^[38] By 1992, the International Conference on Transgender Law
   and Employment Policy defined transgender as an expansive umbrella term
   including "transsexuals, transgenderists, cross dressers", and anyone
   transitioning.^[42] Leslie Feinberg's pamphlet, "Transgender
   Liberation: A Movement Whose Time has Come", circulated in 1992,
   identified transgender as a term to unify all forms of gender
   nonconformity; in this way transgender has become synonymous with
   queer.^[43] In 1994, gender theorist Susan Stryker defined transgender
   as encompassing "all identities or practices that cross over, cut
--
   Between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s, the primary terms used under
   the transgender umbrella were "female to male" (FtM) for men who
   transitioned from female to male, and "male to female" (MtF) for women
--
   "FtM") to terms highlighting gender identity and expression
   ("transgender", "trans man") reflects a broader shift in the
   understanding of transgender people's sense of self and the increasing
   recognition of those who decline medical reassignment as part of the
   transgender community.^[45]

   Transgender can also refer specifically to a person whose gender
   identity is opposite (rather than different from) the sex the person
--

   Transgendered is a common term in older literature. Many within the
   transgender community deprecate it on the basis that transgender is an
   adjective, not a verb.^[51] Organizations such as GLAAD and The
   Guardian also state that transgender should never be used as a noun
   (e.g., "Max is transgender" or "Max is a transgender man", not "Max is
   a transgender").^[5]^[52] "Transgender" is also a noun for the broader
   topic of transgender identity and experience.^[53]

   Although the term "transgenderism" was once considered acceptable, it
   has come to be viewed as offensive, according to GLAAD.^[54] In 2020
   the International Journal of Transgenderism changed its name to the
   International Journal of Transgender Health "to reflect a change toward
   more appropriate and acceptable use of language in our field."^[55]

   Distinctions between the terms transgender and transsexual are commonly
   based on distinctions between gender and sex.^[61]^[62] Transsexuality
   may be said to deal more with physical aspects of one's sex, while
   transgender considerations deal more with one's psychological gender
   disposition or predisposition, as well as the related social
   expectations that may accompany a given gender role.^[63] Many
   transgender people reject the term transsexual.^[3]^[64]^[5] Christine
   Jorgensen publicly rejected transsexual in 1979 and instead identified

   sexuality.^[67]^[better source needed]^[note 3]^[failed verification]
   Some transsexual people object to being included in the transgender
   umbrella.^[68]^[69]^[70]

   In his 2007 book Imagining Transgender: An Ethnography of a Category,
   anthropologist David Valentine asserts that transgender was coined and
   used by activists to include many people who do not necessarily
   identify with the term and states that people who do not identify with
   the term transgender should not be included in the transgender
   spectrum.^[68] Leslie Feinberg likewise asserts that transgender is not
   a self-identifier (for some people) but a category imposed by observers
   to understand other people.^[69] According to the Transgender Health
   Program (THP) at Fenway Health in Boston, there are no

   Main articles: Transgender history and Third gender

   A precise history of the global occurrence of transgender people is
   difficult to assess because the modern concept of being transgender,
   and of gender in general in relation to transgender identity, did not
   develop until the mid-1900s. Historical depictions, records and
--
   Some historians consider the Roman emperor Elagabalus to have been
   transgender. Elagabalus was reported to have dressed in a feminine
   manner, preferred to be called "Lady" instead of "Lord" and may have
--
   "melancholy", or "hysterical" psychiatric disease. By the early 1800s,
   being transgender separate from Hippocrates' idea of it was claimed to
   be widely known, but remained poorly documented. Both trans women and
   trans men were cited in European insane asylums of the early 1800s. One
   of the earliest recorded transgender people in America was Thomas(ine)
   Hall, a seventeenth century colonial servant.^[113] The most complete
--
   (1728–1810), a French diplomat. As cross-dressing became more
   widespread in the late 1800s, discussion of transgender people
   increased greatly and writers attempted to explain the origins of being
   transgender. Much study came out of Germany, and was exported to other
   Western audiences. Cross-dressing was seen in a pragmatic light until
--
   purpose. But in the latter half of the 1800s, cross-dressing and being
   transgender became viewed as an increasing societal danger.^[105]

   associates in the American Neurological Association) had noted the
   widespread nature of transgender cultural practices among native
   peoples. Explanations varied, but authors generally did not ascribe
   native transgender practices to psychiatric causes, instead condemning
   the practices in a religious and moral sense. Native groups provided

   with the works of Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfeld coined the term
   "transvestite" in 1910 as the scope of transgender study grew. His work
   would lead to the 1919 founding of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft
--
   in 1933, and its research was infamously burned in the May 1933 Nazi
   book burnings.^[114] Transgender issues went largely out of the public
   eye until after World War II. Even when they re-emerged, they reflected

   disorders. The DSM-5 refers to the topic as gender dysphoria (GD) while
   reinforcing the idea that being transgender is not considered a mental
   illness.^[122]

   Transgender people may meet the criteria for a diagnosis of gender
   dysphoria "only if [being transgender] causes distress or
   disability."^[123] This distress may manifest as depression or
   inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This
   diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that all transgender
   people suffer from GD, which has confused transgender people and those
   who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are
   comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing

   Clinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to
   adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of
   practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this
   population of individuals.^[124] Many mental healthcare providers know
   little about transgender issues. Those who seek help from these
   professionals often educate the professional without receiving
   help.^[117] This solution usually is good for transsexual people but is
   not the solution for other transgender people, particularly non-binary
   people who lack an exclusively male or female identity. Instead,
--

   Research on the specific problems faced by the transgender community in
   mental health has focused on diagnosis and clinicians' experiences
   instead of transgender clients' experiences.^[125] Therapy was not
   always sought by transgender people due to mental health needs. Prior
   to the seventh version of the Standards of Care (SOC), an individual

   of flexibility in order to meet the diverse health care needs of
   transsexual, transgender, and all gender-nonconforming people.^[126]

   The reasons for seeking mental health services vary according to the
   individual. A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily
   mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of
   dealing with stigma and experiencing transphobia pushes many
   transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life,
   as one trans woman reflected: "Transgendered individuals are going to
   come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do,
   specifically, with being transgendered. It has to do because they've
   had to hide, they've had to lie, and they've felt all of this guilt and
   shame, unfortunately usually for years!"^[125] Many transgender people
   also seek mental health treatment for depression and anxiety caused by
   the stigma attached to being transgender, and some transgender people
   have stressed the importance of acknowledging their gender identity
--

   Problems still remain surrounding misinformation about transgender
   issues that hurt transgender people's mental health experiences. One
   trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate
   program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training:
   "Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe
   that's it. I don't think I've had any formal training just going
--
   uninsured, which raises concerns about the insufficient training most
   therapists receive prior to working with transgender clients,
   potentially increasing financial strain on clients without providing
   the treatment they need.^[125] Many clinicians who work with
   transgender clients only receive mediocre training on gender identity,
   but introductory training on interacting with transgender people has
   recently been made available to health care professionals to help
   remove barriers and increase the level of service for the transgender
   population.^[128] In February 2010, France became the first country in
   the world to remove transgender identity from the list of mental
   diseases.^[129]^[130]

   Feminist views on transgender women have changed over time, but have

   "true" women, and as invading women-only spaces.^[180]^[181] Though
   second-wave feminism argued for the sex and gender distinction, some
   feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity
   and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female
   transition abandoned or devalued female identity and that transgender
   people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes.^[182] By the

   A common symbol for the transgender community is the Transgender Pride
   Flag, which was designed by the American transgender woman Monica Helms
   in 1999, and was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona, in
   2000. The flag consists of five horizontal stripes: light blue, pink,
   white, pink, and light blue^[256] Other transgender symbols include the
   butterfly (symbolizing transformation or metamorphosis),^[257] and a

       and can cause tense confusion and grammatical errors. It also
       brings transgender into alignment with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
