   What does transgender mean?

   Transgender is a term used to describe people whose gender identity
   differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Gender identity is a
--
   girl.) For some people, their gender identity does not fit neatly into
   those two choices. For transgender people, the sex they were assigned
   at birth and their own internal gender identity do not match.

   People in the transgender community may describe themselves using one
   (or more) of a wide variety of terms, including (but not limited to)
   transgender, transsexual, and non-binary. Always use the term used by
   the person.
--
   trying to change a person’s sexual orientation — it doesn’t work. So
   most transgender people seek to bring their bodies into alignment with
   their gender identity. This is called transition.

   As part of the transition process, many transgender people are
   prescribed hormones by their doctors to change their bodies. Some
   undergo surgeries as well. But not all transgender people can or will
   take those steps, and it’s important to know that being transgender is
   not dependent upon medical procedures.

   Transgender is an adjective and should never be used as a noun. For
   example, rather than saying “Max is a transgender,” say “Max is a
   transgender person” or “Max is a transgender man.” And transgender
   never needs an “-ed” at the end.

   We use the acronym LGBTQ to describe the lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, transgender, queer community. The Q can also sometimes mean
   questioning.
--

   Like everyone else, transgender people have a sexual orientation.
   Transgender people may be straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer.
   For example, a person who transitions from male to female and is
--
   men would typically identify as a gay man.
   What does non-binary mean, and is it different from being transgender?

--
   some people their gender identity is different than the sex they were
   assigned at birth (transgender).
   There have always been transgender people who felt that their gender
   identity didn’t fall neatly into the two binary categories of “man” or
--
   describe their gender identity typically also call themselves
   transgender.
   In recent years,  the word non-binary has seen a surge in popularity.
--
   Many of those people either explictly say something like, “I’m not
   transgender, I’m non-binary,” implying those are two identities are
   unrelated, or they will simply never use the word transgender when
   describing themselves.
--
   that there is no one right or wrong way to be non-binary, just like
   there is no right or wrong way to be transgender.
   The bottom line is: listen to how someone uses the word non-binary to
   describe themselves and try to understand how they are using it. Many
   of them will be telling you that they are a transgender person who is
   non-binary, while others will be using non-binary in a different way to
--

   For some transgender people, being associated with their birth name is
   a tremendous source of anxiety, or it is simply a part of their life
   they wish to leave behind. Respect the name a transgender person is
   currently using. If you happen to know a transgender person’s birth
   name (the name given to them when they were born, but which they no
   longer use), don’t share it without that person’s explicit permission.
   Sharing a transgender person’s birth name and/or photos of a
   transgender person before their transition is an invasion of privacy,
   unless they have given you permission to do so.

   everyone.

   Why is transgender equality important?

   and violence. In 2016, 27 transgender people were killed. Since January
   1, 2017, eight transgender women of color have been murdered.

       general population
     * 30% of transgender people report being homeless at some point in
       their lives, with 12% saying it was within the past 12 months

       general population, with rates for people of color up to 4x the
       national unemployment rate

       equal service, 24% who were verbally harassed, and 2% who were
       physically attacked because they were transgender
