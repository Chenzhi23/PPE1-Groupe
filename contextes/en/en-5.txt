   ["I'm a transgender woman. That means my birth certificate said 'male,'
      but I always knew I was a girl. I was so relieved when I told my mom
       about how I felt - and instead of being mad, she was supportive." -

   Understanding what it is like to be transgender can be hard, especially
   if you have never met a transgender person.

   Transgender is a broad term that can be used to describe people whose
   gender identity is different from the gender they were thought to be
   when they were born. "Trans" is often used as shorthand for
   transgender.

   To treat a transgender person with respect, you treat them according to
   their gender identity, not their sex at birth. So, someone who lives as
   a woman today is called a transgender woman and should be referred to
   as "she" and "her." A transgender man lives as a man today and should
   be referred to as "he" and "him."

   outside.That might include behavior, clothing, hairstyle, voice or body
   characteristics. Everyone has a gender identity, including cisgender -
   or non-transgender - people. If someone's gender identity matches the
   gender they were assigned at birth, then they are cisgender, or "cis"
   for short.

   than the gender they were thought to be when they were born, this time
   period is called gender transition. Deciding to transition can take a
   lot of reflection. Many transgender people risk social stigma,
   discrimination, and harassment when they tell other people who they
   really are. Despite those risks, being open about one's gender identity

   hormone therapy or other medical procedures to change their physical
   characteristics and make their body match the gender they know
   themselves to be. All transgender people are entitled to the same
   dignity and respect, regardless of whether or not they have been able
   to take any legal or medical steps.

   Some transgender people identify as neither a man nor a woman, or as a
   combination of male and female, and may use terms like nonbinary or
   genderqueer to describe their gender identity. Those who are nonbinary
   often prefer to be referred to as "they" and "them."

   It is important to use respectful terminology, and treat transgender
   people as you would treat any other person. This includes using the
   name the person has asked you to call them (not their old name) as well
