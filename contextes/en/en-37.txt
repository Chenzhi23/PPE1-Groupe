Canada is the first country to provide census data on transgender and non-binary

   question on the census questionnaire, and a new question on gender was
   included. As a result, the historical continuity of information on sex
   was maintained while allowing all cisgender, transgender and non-binary
   individuals to report their gender. This addressed an important
   information gap on gender diversity (see Filling the gaps: Information
--
   For many people, their gender corresponds to their sex at birth
   (cisgender men and cisgender women). For some, these do not align
   (transgender men and transgender women) or their gender is not
   exclusively "man" or "woman" (non-binary people).

   The strength of the census is to provide reliable data for local
   communities throughout the country and for smaller populations such as
   the transgender and non-binary populations. Statistics Canada always
   protects privacy and confidentiality of respondents when disseminating
   detailed data.

   These modifications reflect today's reality in terms of the evolving
   acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual diversity and an
   emerging social and legislative recognition of transgender, non-binary
   and LGBTQ2+ people in general, that is, people who are lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, or who use other terms
   related to gender or sexual diversity. In 2017, the Canadian government
   amended the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Criminal Code to

   These data can be used by public decision makers, employers, and
   providers of health care, education, justice, and other services to
   better meet the needs of all men and women--including transgender men
   and women--and non-binary people in their communities.

--
   The 2021 Census of Population included for the first time a question on
   gender and the precision of "at birth" on the sex question, allowing
   all cisgender, transgender and non-binary individuals to report their
   gender.

   Of the nearly 30.5 million people in Canada aged 15 and older living in
   a private household in May 2021, 100,815 were transgender (59,460) or
   non-binary (41,355), accounting for 0.33% of the population in this age
   group.

   The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were three to
   seven times higher for Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2006, 0.79%)
   and millennials (born between 1981 and 1996, 0.51%) than for Generation

   diversity has evolved. Further, there has been social and legislative
   recognition of transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people in general.
   Younger generations may be more comfortable reporting their gender
   identity than older generations.

   In May 2021, the Canadian population aged 15 and older had an average
   age of 48.0 years. In comparison, the transgender population had an
   average age of 39.4 years, while the non-binary population had an
   average age of 30.4 years.

   Just under 1 in 100 young adults aged 20 to 24 were non-binary or
   transgender (0.85%).

   Nova Scotia (0.48%), Yukon (0.47%) and British Columbia (0.44%) had the
   highest proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 and
   older among provinces and territories.

--
   Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary people aged 15 and older (15.5%) lived in the
   downtown core of a large urban centre. This share was more than twice
   that of transgender people (7.0%) and over three times higher than that
   of cisgender people (4.7%).

One in 300 people in Canada aged 15 and older are transgender or non-binary

   In May 2021, there were 59,460 people in Canada aged 15 and older
   living in a private household who were transgender (0.19%)
   and 41,355 who were non-binary (0.14%). Together, they
   represented 1 in 300 people, or 0.33% of the population aged 15 and
   older.

   valuable insight into gender diversity globally.

   In Canada, 0.2% of the population aged 18 and older was transgender
   in 2021. Belgium (0.5% among people aged 18 to 75 in 2021) and New
   Zealand (0.5% among people aged 18 and older in 2020) have also
   published representative survey-based data on their transgender
   populations.

   Other countries have published 2021 data on transgender people using
   crowdsourcing and non-representative surveys, including Ireland (0.6%
   among people aged 18 and older), England and Wales (0.6% among people
--
   aged 18 and older).

   Among the 59,460 transgender people, there were more transgender women
   (31,555) than transgender men (27,905).

   Generation Z: people aged 15 to 24 (born between 1997 and 2006)

   Younger generations had larger shares of those who were transgender or
   non-binary. The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were
   three to seven times higher for Generation Z (0.79%) and millennials
   (0.51%) than for Generation X (0.19%), baby boomers (0.15%) and the

   gender diversity--especially among younger generations--by providing
   transgender and non-binary individuals with virtual support communities
   and answers to questions that were less accessible to older
   generations.

Non-binary and transgender people are younger on average than cisgender people

   In May 2021, the Canadian population aged 15 and older had an average
   age of 48.0 years. In comparison, the transgender population had an
   average age of 39.4 years, while the non-binary population had an
   average age of 30.4 years.

   Transgender men (34.9 years) were almost a decade younger on average
   than transgender women (43.3 years).

   Close to two-thirds (62.0%) of the 100,815 individuals who were
   transgender or non-binary were younger than 35.

   Gender diversity was highest among those aged 20 to 24,
   almost 1 in 100 (0.85%) of whom were transgender or non-binary. In
   comparison, 1 in 700 were transgender or non-binary among people
   aged 65 and older.

Among provinces and territories, Nova Scotia, Yukon and British Columbia show
the highest proportions of transgender and non-binary individuals

   Although transgender and non-binary people lived in every province and
   territory in Canada, they were concentrated in certain areas.
   Almost 2 in 5 transgender or non-binary people (39.1%) called Ontario
   home in 2021 (39,450), and this corresponds to Ontario's share of
   Canada's population aged 15 and older (38.8%).

   Gender diversity varies by region. Provincially, almost 1 in 200 people
   living in Nova Scotia (0.48%) and British Columbia (0.44%) were
   transgender or non-binary, proportions above the national average
   of 0.33%. Although counts were lower, Yukon (0.47%) also had one of the
   highest proportions in Canada.

   Among the provinces, Quebec had the smallest proportions of transgender
   (0.14%) and non-binary (0.09%) people, followed by Saskatchewan (0.16%
   and 0.12%, respectively).

About 1 in 100 people aged 15 to 34 in Nova Scotia and British Columbia are
transgender or non-binary

   Gender diversity was more common among people aged 15 to 34 than those
   aged 35 and older. Approximately 1 in 150 people aged 15 to 34 in
   Canada were transgender or non-binary (0.69%), compared
   with 1 in 550 people aged 35 and older (0.18%).

   Nova Scotia (1.17%) and British Columbia (0.90%) had the largest
   proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 to 34 among
   provinces, while Quebec (0.52%) and Saskatchewan (0.59%) had the lowest
   proportions.

   Among people aged 15 to 34, about 1 in 500 (0.20%) in Canada were
   transgender men and 1 in 650 (0.15%) were transgender women. The
   largest proportions of transgender men aged 15 to 34 were found in Nova
   Scotia (0.33%), New Brunswick (0.26%), and Newfoundland and Labrador
   (0.26%), while Nova Scotia (0.21%), Newfoundland and Labrador (0.19%),
   and British Columbia (0.19%) had the largest proportions of transgender
   women.

   Urban living was more popular among non-binary individuals than among
   transgender and cisgender individuals. In 2021, over 9 in 10 non-binary
   people aged 15 and older in Canada (92.5%) lived in an urban centre of
   over 100,000 people, also called a census metropolitan area (CMA), or a

   Among all CMAs, the largest proportions of transgender and non-binary
   people aged 15 and older were found in Victoria (0.75%), Halifax
   (0.66%) and Fredericton (0.60%), on the west and the east coasts of

   All three urban centres are home to several major colleges and

   Ottawa-Gatineau (5.6%), Edmonton (5.4%) and Calgary (4.5%).

   Just under half of transgender women (49.1%) and transgender men
   (47.0%) aged 15 and older lived in 1 of these 6 largest urban centres,
   proportions similar to those of cisgender women (47.9%) and cisgender
   men (47.3%) living in these CMAs.

   While Quebec had the lowest proportion of transgender and non-binary
   people among the provinces, almost three-quarters (71.5%) of the
   non-binary people and over half (54.7%) of the transgender people in
   Quebec lived in the CMA of Montréal. By way of comparison, half of all
   Quebec residents aged 15 and older lived in the Montréal CMA.
--

   Living in a downtown core was also more popular for non-binary people
   than for transgender and cisgender people. Nearly 1 in 6 non-binary
   people aged 15 and older in Canada (15.5%) were living in the downtown
   of one of the country's 41 CMAs, and 7.3% lived in the downtown of 1 of
   the 6 largest CMAs. The proportion of non-binary individuals living in
   one of the CMA downtowns was over twice that of transgender (7.0%) and
   cisgender (4.7%) individuals.

   In Canada, approximately 1 in 200 people aged 15 and older living in a
   CMA downtown were non-binary (0.45%). Comparatively, 1 in 350 people
   were transgender men (0.13%) or transgender women (0.16%).

   Fredericton (1.8%), Nanaimo (1.5%) and Halifax (1.5%) had the largest
   proportions of transgender and non-binary people aged 15 and older
   living downtown.

--
   institutions within downtown cores, combined with a more cosmopolitan
   atmosphere and the greater availability of social spaces and
   specialized services for transgender, non-binary and LGBTQ2+ people
   more broadly, may also explain the higher presence of non-binary people
   in the heart of large urban centres.
--
   large-scale household survey conducted by Statistics Canada to collect
   information about sex at birth and gender of respondents. It found
   that 1 in 400 people in Canada aged 15 and older were transgender or
   non-binary (0.24%).

   The survey also revealed important differences in victimization,
   discrimination and mental health by the gender diversity status of
   respondents. For example, almost two-thirds of transgender and
   non-binary individuals (65%) reported poor or fair mental health, five
   times the proportion of those who were cisgender (11%). Transgender and

   A socioeconomic analysis of the LGBTQ2+ population suggests transgender
   and non-binary populations may not have had the resources to cope with
   unexpected financial stress. According to the 2018 Canadian Housing

   In 2019, Trans PULSE Canada conducted a national community-based survey
   on the health and well-being of close to 3,000 transgender and
   non-binary people aged 14 and older, of whom around 800 respondents
   participated in a COVID-19 survey the following year. Results show that
   transgender and non-binary participants, who experienced greater levels
   of economic insecurity and social marginalization before the pandemic,
   may have been particularly affected. They found that a majority of
   transgender and non-binary people experienced both negative financial
   and social impacts from the pandemic.

   tables on couples. In particular, there will be analysis of same-gender
   and different-gender couples, as well as couples composed of at least
   one transgender person or at least one non-binary person.

   Family and household characteristics and sociocultural and
   socioeconomic data from the 2021 Census released over the next months
   will continue to enrich the portrait of the transgender and non-binary
   populations in Canada.

   private households by sex (from 1991 to 2016) and sex at birth
