   Background. Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs
   from the sex they were assigned at birth. The population size of
   transgender individuals in the United States is not well-known, in part
   because official records, including the US Census, do not include data
   on gender identity. Population surveys today more often collect
   transgender-inclusive gender-identity data, and secular trends in
   culture and the media have created a somewhat more favorable
   environment for transgender people.

   Objectives. To estimate the current population size of transgender
   individuals in the United States and evaluate any trend over time.
--
   Selection criteria. We selected population-based surveys that used
   probability sampling and included self-reported transgender-identity
   data.
--
   pool eligible surveys and used meta-regression to address our
   hypothesis that the transgender population size estimate would increase
   over time. We used subsample and leave-one-out analysis to assess for
--
   Authors' conclusions. Future national surveys are likely to observe
   higher numbers of transgender people. The large variety in questions
   used to ask about transgender identity may account for residual
   heterogeneity in our models.

   Public health implications. Under- or nonrepresentation of transgender
   individuals in population surveys is a barrier to understanding social
--
   recommend using standardized questions to identify respondents with
   transgender and nonbinary gender identities, which will allow a more
   accurate population size estimate.
--
   We used data from national surveys to estimate the population size of
   transgender people in the United States. Estimates of the number of
   transgender adults significantly increased over the past decade, with a
   current best estimate of 390 per 100 000 adults. That is about 1 in
--
   more typical of younger adults than of the entire US population. We
   expect that future surveys will find higher numbers of transgender
   people and recommend that standardized questions be used, which will

   Meta-Regression Showing the Proportion of Transgender Adults Against
   Survey Year

   Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs from the
   sex they were assigned at birth.^1 Research has shown that transgender
   individuals around the world and in the United States are exposed to
--
   sexual abuse.^2,3 Compared with the general population, a national
   survey conducted in the United States in 2008 found that transgender
   individuals were 4 times more likely to live in extreme poverty, had
   double the rate of unemployment, and had almost double the rate of
   being homeless.^4 In terms of health, transgender individuals had 4
   times the rate of being HIV-infected and 28% postponed medical care
--
   understanding social determinants and health disparities faced by
   transgender people is the under- or nonrepresentation in a range of
   demographic and health-monitoring activities,^5 which may result from a
   lack of transgender-inclusive data collection with regard to gender
   identity.

   Accurate representation of the transgender population is complicated by
   the diversity within the community with regard to language and
   subcultures.^6,7 Moreover, the clinical literature has long conflated
   transgender identity with homosexuality.^8,9 Although a relationship
   between gender identity and sexual orientation may exist, the American
   Psychological Association (APA) recognizes that "Transgender people,
   like cis-gender people, may be sexually oriented toward men, women,
   both sexes, or neither sex. . . ."^10,11 Current best practice for
   collecting transgender-inclusive gender identity data is the 2-step
   method, which has been shown to optimize accurate identification of
   transgender people in a population.^12 This method records current
   gender identity as well as the sex assigned at birth; transgender
   people are those who identify as such and those whose current gender
--
   capture of people who identify with a binary gender (male or female),
   such as a transgender man who identifies only as male,^14 as well as
   others who may be considered transgender from a demographic
   perspective, even if they do not identify with the term "transgender,"
   such as people who identify as genderqueer, agender, or having no
--
   whether the legal sex differs from the sex assigned at birth. As a
   result, at the most basic level, the population size of transgender
   individuals in the United States is not well-known.
--
   On the basis of a limited number of sources in 2009, the APA estimated
   the number of transgender individuals in the United States at 115 000
   to 450 000, or 38 to 147 per 100 000 by using US Census data for that
--
   as the lower limit was based on members of a lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   and transgender (LGBT) Web site who identified as transgender, which is
   unlikely to be representative of the US general population, and the
--
   States. More recent US population-based surveys have reported
   transgender population sizes that are higher, ranging from 153 to 1647
   per 100 000.^18 These estimates may not generalize to the United States
--
   that 0.6% of US adults, approximately 560 per 100 000, identify as
   transgender.^21 They used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is administered annually to randomly
--

   Because contemporary surveys more often collect transgender-inclusive
   gender-identity data, and secular trends in culture and the media have
   created a somewhat more favorable environment for transgender people,
   it is possible that the measured size of the transgender population has
   increased over time, rendering previous reports of population size even
   less applicable today. The primary aim of this study was to estimate
   the number of transgender individuals in the United States by
   performing a meta-analysis of population-based national surveys. A
   secondary aim was to evaluate for any trend over time. We hypothesized
   that the estimates of transgender population size would increase over
   time. Knowledge of the transgender population size can support the
   development of social policy that aims to protect transgender
   individuals against stigma and discrimination. From a health
   perspective, knowledge of the size of the transgender population can
   inform the development of health care programs to benefit transgender
   people, as well as inform insurance companies on how to best provide

   contain transgender-inclusive gender-identity data. Eligible surveys
   were population-based and nonclinical, as recommended by Deutsch,^18

   excluded surveys that did not specifically report transgender
   identities (e.g., surveys that reported counts for "another gender" or
   counts for a response option that combined "transgender" and "other").
   We collected gender-identity data for each unique survey located

   We conducted random-effects meta-analyses based on the proportion of
   transgender individuals. Pooling of multiple survey samples, including

   Questions used to collect data on transgender identity varied greatly.
   A majority of surveys (n = 13 or 65%) asked about being transgender in
   the context of gender identity, in accordance with current
   understanding that transgender is a gender identity that is different
   from a person's sex assigned at birth.^1 These surveys included the
--
   collection,^30-37 and the National Inmate Survey.^38-42 The remaining
   surveys (n = 7 or 35%) offered "transgender" as a response option in
   the context of sexual-orientation questions. These surveys included the
   2013 NHIS,^43 the NATS,^29,44,45 and the NCHA before the 2009 wave of
   data collection.^46-48 Although transgender as sexual orientation does
   not reflect current understanding of transgender as a gender identity,
   and sexual orientation and gender identity are distinct
   phenomena,^8,11,14 we conducted separate meta-analyses for
   "transgender" collected as gender identity and "transgender" as sexual
   orientation for the sake of comparison.
--
   Questions that probed gender identity included "Do you consider
   yourself to be transgender?"; "Do you identify as transgender?"; "Are
   you male, female, or transgender?"; and "What is your gender?" In
   addition to male or female gender options, response options included
   "transgender"^31,38 and "male-to-female," "female-to-male," and
   "gender-nonconforming."^27 Sexual-orientation questions with
   transgender response options included "Which of the following best
   describes you?"; "Which of the following best represents how you think
   of yourself?"; and "Do you consider yourself to be. . . ?" or "Do you
   think of yourself as. . .?" Response options included "transgender,"^45
   "transgendered,"^46 and "You are transgender, transsexual, or gender
   variant."^29,43

Transgender Population Size

   The estimated proportion of transgender individuals based on surveys
   that categorized transgender as gender identity was 0.39% (95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 0.16, 0.62; I^2 = 99.8%; k = 13). In terms

   The estimated proportion of transgender individuals based on surveys
   that categorized transgender as sexual orientation was 0.06% (95% CI =
   0.03, 0.09; I^2 = 96.6%; k = 7). It should be noted that presenting
   transgender in the context of sexual orientation does not reflect our
   current understanding of what it means to be transgender. We include
   these data for comparison only and doing so should not be taken as
   validation that presenting transgender as a sexual orientation is in
   any way appropriate. Leave-one-out analysis showed no disproportionate
   effect of single surveys. A direct comparison of estimates showed that
   the proportion for transgender categorized as sexual orientation was
   significantly lower than the overall proportion for transgender
   categorized as gender identity (0.06% vs 0.28%; t = 7.317; P < .001,
--
   Our meta-regression of US population-based surveys indicated a
   substantial annual increase in the number of transgender adults in the
   United States. As a consequence, meta-analyses that pool data across
--
   results, while excluding the latest NCHA wave of data as a potential
   outlier, suggests that the proportion of transgender adults in the
   United States is 0.39%, or 390 per 100 000, and almost 1 million adults
--
   indicative for younger adults and that national surveys in the near
   future may observe higher numbers of transgender people. We speculate
   that the observed annual increase is not an increase of the true
   population size, but the result of people feeling freer to report that
   they are or identify as transgender. This may result from societal
   changes, such as increased public visibility, awareness, and acceptance
   of transgender individuals.^49 The fact that US society is more aware
   of transgender issues is also reflected in public interest in the
   search term "transgender," which, according to Google Trends, has
   steadily increased since 2011. PubMed results for the number of
   publications found with the search term "transgender" show a similar
   phenomenon, with relatively small increases since 2005, but large
--
   differences in social acceptance affect the number of individuals who
   are willing to self-report a transgender identity.^50 This is why we
   based our analysis on US national samples only. Our estimate of 0.39%
--

"Transgender" as a Label

   The label "transgender" is often used as an umbrella term, but does not
   fully capture the larger gender-nonconforming or gender-variant
--
   endorsed "gender-nonconforming." Other surveys that were not eligible
   for our analysis showed an even starker contrast between "transgender"
   and other nonbinary options. In a recent national nonprobability
--
   nonconforming" was about 1.5 times the number who endorsed
   "transgender."^53 In the 2013 and 2015 Minnesota College Student Health
   Survey, twice as many respondents endorsed "genderqueer" or "another
   gender" than "transgender."^54,55

--
   example, 6th- to 12th-grade students in a national sample endorsed
   "genderqueer" more often than "transgender," and the number who
   endorsed "another gender" was almost half of those who endorsed
   "transgender."^15 In a national survey of LGBT individuals in science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics, again, more endorsed
   "genderqueer" than "transgender," whereas the number who endorsed
   "androgynous" was slightly more than half of those who endorsed
   "transgender."^16

   Also, not all transgender people identify with the term "transgender"
   (e.g., a transgender woman who identifies as female only).^14,56 As
   such, surveys that include "transgender" as the only option other than
   male or female are likely to underestimate the population size under
   the transgender umbrella. The available evidence suggests that the size
   of the gender-nonconforming or gender-variant population may be twice
   as large as our best estimate for the transgender population size.

   According to our analysis, surveys that considered transgender a sexual
   orientation resulted in at least a 4-fold underestimate of the number
   of transgender individuals. This underestimate should not come as a
   surprise, because transgender as sexual orientation does not reflect
   current understanding of transgender as gender identity.^11,14 It is
   striking, therefore, that national surveys such as the NHIS and NATS,
   and state surveys such as the Illinois and Idaho BRFSS,^57,58 until
   recent years, have categorized transgender as a sexual orientation
   rather than a gender identity. This practice misrepresents the number
   of transgender people in the United States and sustains misconceptions
   about what it means to be transgender. Of note, as of 2015, the NHIS no
   longer lists transgender as an option under sexual orientation.

--
   Several considerations should be made when one is interpreting the
   results of our study. First, transgender people differ greatly and not
   all transgender individuals desire or have the resources to seek
   surgeries, hormone therapy, or change their name or sex designation on
   legal documents.^1 We believe that our analysis based on self-reported
   data provides a more accurate estimate of the number of transgender
   individuals than estimates based on characteristics that represent
   subsamples of the transgender population only (e.g., only those who
   seek surgery).
--
   and university students), and research has shown that individuals aged
   18 to 24 years are more likely to identify as transgender.^21 Also, the
   incarceration rate among transgender individuals is disproportionally
   high,^4 especially among transgender women, and as such they may be
   overrepresented in samples drawn from the inmate population, which
--
   from their current gender identity could be as large as our current
   estimate of the transgender population size. As such, our analysis may
   not have captured all individuals who are considered transgender from a
   demographic perspective, but who do not identify explicitly with the
   term "transgender." How the sum of these factors that may have affected
   our estimate ultimately add up is a complex question that perhaps can
--
   they are expected to be small, may have affected our estimate,
   especially because the base rate of the transgender population is
   small.
--
   respondent characteristics (e.g., general population, students,
   inmates) and the types of questions used to assess transgender
   identity.^59 For example, the 2015 wave of the NCHA asked about
   respondents' gender with 0.45% endorsing transgender, whereas
   respondents in the 2016 wave were asked whether they identified as
   transgender (1.8% responded yes). The small number of surveys in our
   analysis did not allow for testing more than 1 model predictor.
--

   We aimed to estimate the current transgender population size in the
   United States. On the basis of our analysis of national probability
   samples, 390 per 100 000 adults are estimated to be transgender in
   2016, but the evidence suggests that future surveys will likely observe
   higher numbers. Our analysis also found that surveys use a variety of
   questions to ask about transgender identity and may still miscategorize
   transgender as a sexual orientation. This categorization does not
   reflect current understanding of transgender as a gender identity, and
   we recommend using standardized questions to identify respondents with
   transgender and nonbinary gender identities in future population
   surveys. Best practices regarding questions that can be used for
   transgender-inclusive data collection have already been published.^13
