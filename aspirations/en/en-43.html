          <div class="c_itd_main_inn">
            <p>This  section describes</a> choices related to physical appearance: </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="#gender">Gender  expression.</a></li>

            <h3 class="tg_h3">Gender expression </h3>
            <p>Gender expression, as  opposed to gender identity, is what is on the outside. It is how people express  their gender to others.</p>
            <p>All people make daily choices  about what clothes to wear; whether and how to use or not use accessories,  jewelry, and/or makeup; and how their hair is cut or styled. Most people have a  specific look or style that is personally comfortable. This may also include  how individuals walk, sit, or carry themselves.</p>
            <p>In the United States, women  and men often are expected to make appearance-related choices from mutually  exclusive sets of options. For example, although women may wear feminine-tailored  clothing, use makeup, have a feminine hairstyle, and act &quot;femininely,&quot; these  gender expressions are very rarely considered acceptable for men. Other  examples include separate women's and men's clothing departments, jewelry and  watch display cases, and hygiene-related store shelves. </p>
            <p>A growing number of non-transgender  individuals are breaking traditional gender norms. Male goth youth, for  example, wear eyeliner and fingernail polish; business women wear pantsuits  without makeup or jewelry; metrosexual men use moisturizing products and get  manicures. Although gender expression is less rigid with each passing year, in  large part expectations to conform to the stereotypes remain in place.</p>
            <p>Transgender people may decide  to consistently present as male or female in alignment with societal norms. They  may also deliberately choose both male and female gender expressions and thus  have mixed, gender non-conforming, or genderfluid presentation. Some are more fluid about  their gender expression, which they may change from day to day, hour to hour, or  setting to setting either because they feel they have to (e.g., an individual  chooses not to transition at work) or because they want to. </p>
            <div class="wtm_sidebar">
              <div class="wtm_sidebar_content">
                <div class="h3_alttag_wtm"><img src="images/r_wtm_sb_top.jpg" width="223" height="34" alt="What's That Mean?"></div>
                <div class="wtm_sidebar_c_inner">
                  <ul class="wtm_ul">
                    <li><a href="about_language.html#ftm">FTM</a></li>
                    <li><a href="about_language.html#mtf">MTF</a></li>
                  </ul>

              </div>
              <div class="wtm_sidebar_bottom"></div>
            </div>
            <p>Some transgender people  express gender in very traditional or overt ways to better &quot;pass&quot;  as the gender with which they identify. For example, a male-to-female (MTF)  transgender person may always wear skirts and stereotypically feminine blouses,  paired with matching earrings and pristine makeup. A female-to-male (FTM)  individual may wear a pressed oxford shirt and tie, dress pants and buffed  shoes, and neatly trimmed short hair. In these cases, there is an intentional  effort to send very clear, gendered messages to others.</p>
            <p>Often, as people are in  the process of figuring out what feels most comfortable for themselves, they  may experiment with styles and looks. They may later relax into more  comfortable clothes, or clothes that reflect their own personal sense of style,  rather than basing their choices on rigid cultural norms.</p>
            <p>Body image can play a  role in how people express their gender. Transgender people generally have an  even more uncomfortable or negative relationship with their bodies than  non-transgender people. Some create a literal armor to hide or alter their  bodies or to create a different bodily contour:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>Some       FTMs (or other people on the trans-masculine spectrum)&#151;</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Bind        their chests. </li>
              <li>Wear        baggy or multiple layers of clothing to help flatten the appearance of        their chest.</li>
              <li>Wear        self-made or store-bought penile prosthetics. </li>
              <li>Use        prosthetics to allow them to urinate while standing. </li>
              <li>Slouch        or intentionally gain weight to add mass to their midsection, altering        their feminine contour.</li>
            </ul>
           <li>Some       MTFs (or other people on the trans-feminine spectrum)&#151;</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Use        breast or hip forms to create a more feminine contour. </li>
              <li>&quot;Gaff&quot;        or &quot;tuck&quot; (i.e., pull back their genitals to create a smoother line). </li>
              <li>Wear        wigs.</li>
              <li>Dress        in a highly stereotypical feminine way to create an outward appearance of        undeniable femaleness. </li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Safety can also be a  major component of how gender is expressed. More detail about safety is found  in the <a href="transgender_passing.html">Passing  section</a> of  this e-pub.</p>

            <p>Some transgender  people&#151;but by no means all&#151;use hormones as part of their medical transition. According  to the National Center for Transgender Equality's (NCTE) groundbreaking study  of 6,450 transgender individuals, 62 percent of respondents have had some  hormone therapy and 23 percent hope to have it in the future.<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn10" name="_ednref10" id="_ednref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Hormones are available in  injectable, pill, patch, and gel/cream formats.</p>
            <p>Hormones help shift bodies  into a more traditionally masculine or feminine form. Using testosterone, for  example, can deepen the voice, activate facial and body hair growth,  redistribute fat, cause the clitoris to enlarge, and may stimulate male pattern  balding. Vaginal tissue typically becomes more fragile and less elastic and may  not lubricate easily. The vaginal opening may become smaller and tighter,  especially if the person does not use their vagina for consensual sexual  penetration. Testosterone use usually, but not always, results in the cessation  of menstrual cycles and renders the individual infertile. Using estrogen,  progesterone, and anti-androgens can cause breast growth, reduce body hair, redistribute  body fat, soften the skin, cause some loss of muscle mass, and increase the  risk of blood clots, particularly following surgery and in people who smoke. Although  mood swings are a typical side effect of hormones in the first few years of  use, people who use them frequently report that hormones make them calmer and  happier.<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn11" name="_ednref11" id="_ednref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
            <p>Because some of the  changes from hormone use are permanent, some transgender people stop using  hormones once they have achieved specific physical goals. Others stop for  health reasons or because they become unable to afford hormones (which may not  be covered by health insurance, even for those who have insurance). Others continue  lifelong use, which is generally recommended for anyone who no longer generates  their own hormones due to a hysterectomy (removal of the ovaries and uterus) or  orchiectomy (removal of the testes), or due to age (when hormone levels  naturally decline). </p>
            <p>People can acquire hormones  from a health care provider or clinic&#151;the safest method&#151;but they may also get  them on the street, from friends, or online (frequently without any medical  supervision or monitoring). Non-physician prescribed hormones are relatively  common due to a lack of access to health care, an inability to afford physician  visits and routine laboratory tests, a preference not to see a physician, or a  preference to avoid or an inability to afford psychotherapy, which a  
            physician may require prior to  prescribing hormones.<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn12" name="_ednref12" id="_ednref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

                  <p> Some MTFs inject  silicone to feminize their bodies. Silicone use is particularly prevalent among  MTFs involved in the sex trade because it creates a feminine appearance without  the use of hormones, which may limit erectile function and reduce their  employment options.<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn13" name="_ednref13" id="_ednref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
                  <p>Although injected silicone  has an immediate outcome, it also carries many serious health risks, including  migration of the silicone away from the desired area, systemic illness, and  even death.<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn14" name="_ednref14" id="_ednref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In addition, because  injection often happens in peer-based group settings and in less-than-sterile  environments, needles may be re-used or shared, increasing the risk of acquiring  HIV, hepatitis, and other blood-borne infections. </p>
                  <p><em>Note:</em> FTMs may also use  silicone to alter the shape and contour of their bodies.</p>

            <p>If people acquire  hormones through a health care provider, that provider should monitor  the individuals' laboratory results and physical wellness. Many providers  adhere to a standard of care to guide their treatment of transgender patients,  which requires that a mental health professional also be involved.<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn15" name="_ednref15" id="_ednref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Most standards of care  require that transgender clients participate in therapy for a time, typically 3  months to 1 year, after which the mental health care provider will write a  letter stating that the client is ready to start medical treatment. This  &quot;gatekeeping&quot; model can create additional challenges. For example, transgender  people who visit mental health professionals may omit certain details about  their lives out of fear that they will be denied the letter required by the standard  of care. Past traumas, current mental health issues, or drug or alcohol use are  generally known to have been used as justification for withholding these letters.  A growing number of LGBT community health clinics and individual providers,  however, are moving from standards of care to informed consent models of care,  giving both transgender patients and providers more flexibility, autonomy, and  control over the health care process.<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn16" name="_ednref16" id="_ednref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
            <p>The risks associated  with medically supervised hormone use are in line with the risks of many other  medications. Routine monitoring, moderate dosing, a healthy lifestyle (e.g., exercise,  healthy diet, adequate rest, low-to-moderate stress), and well-managed medical  conditions (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, other common or rare  conditions) help to minimize the risks associated with hormone use.</p>
            <p>Economics, access to  medical care, and access to physicians who are willing to prescribe hormones  often influence how and whether people obtain hormones as a part of their  medical transition. </p>

            <h3 class="tg_h3"> Surgery </h3>
            <p>Non-transgender people frequently  believe there is one &quot;transgender surgery,&quot; which involves the genitals. The  reality is that there is no &quot;one&quot; surgery and that multiple options or  combinations of surgeries can help people change their bodies to be more  closely in line with their gender identity. As with hormone use, health care  providers operating under standards of care may require their transgender  clients to participate in therapy before surgery. In fact, surgeons  specializing in gender-related surgeries often require letters from two mental health professionals rather than  just one.</p>
            <p>The following data on  surgeries were taken from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey  conducted in 2011<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn17" name="_ednref17" id="_ednref17"><sup>17</sup></a>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The       most common <strong>FTM surgeries</strong> are       mastectomy or chest reconstruction (41 percent) and hysterectomy (20 percent). Few have       phalloplasty (construction of a penis) (2 percent) or other genital surgery (e.g., metoidioplasty       and/or construction of testes) (3 percent)       because of their high cost and frequent complications, and       dissatisfaction with the results. </li>
              <li><strong>MTF surgeries</strong> can involve breast augmentation (18 percent), facial feminization surgery       (e.g., creating a less prominent brow or chin, shaving the Adams apple),       vaginoplasty (creating a vagina) (20 percent), and/or removal of the       testes (21 percent). Because of the       danger of attracting anti-transgender violence in public, some transgender       women consider breast augmentation and facial feminization surgeries higher       priorities than genital surgery. </li>

                  <p> Cutting, or  non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as a way of coping with abuse and stress is  common among transgender people. In a study of 977 individuals, almost 42 percent  had a history of NSSI, as compared to 4–38 percent in the non-transgender  population. FTMs had substantially higher rates of NSSI. Of transgender people  who were prevented from transitioning (denied letters for hormones or surgery),  50 percent had a history of NSSI.<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn18" name="_ednref18" id="_ednref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

            </div>
            <p>Genital surgery, as noted above, is far  more common for MTFs than FTMs. The difference in function and aesthetics may  be among the reasons for this disparity, as well as the difference in cost for  vaginoplasty (cheaper) versus phalloplasty (much more expensive).</p>
            <p>On rare occasions, some transgender  people who have been unable to access surgeries due to cost and/or surgeons'  refusals to operate have attempted self-surgery to remove their breasts, penis,  or testicles. </p>

            <p>Contrary to popular  belief, many transgender people do not feel the need to surgically alter their  bodies. For that reason, combined with prohibitive costs, lack of access, and  worries about functionality and aesthetics, FORGE believes that most transgender people do not have  gender-related surgery. This underlying belief is supported by the National  Transgender Discrimination Survey's broad  sample of transgender individuals and their experiences and desires with/for  surgery.<a href="transgender_notes.html#_edn19" name="_ednref19" id="_ednref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
