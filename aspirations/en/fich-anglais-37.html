<h2>Filling gaps in gender diversity data in Canada</h2><p>Prior to the&#160;2021&#160;Census, some individuals indicated that they were not able to see themselves in the two responses of male or female on the existing sex question in the census. </p><p>Following <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/consultation/92-137-x/92-137-x2019001-eng.cfm">extensive consultation and countrywide engagement</a> with the Canadian population, the census evolve<span class="nowrap">d&#8212;a</span>s it has for more than a centur<span class="nowrap">y&#8212;t</span>o reflect societal changes, adding new content on gender in&#160;2021.</p><p>Beginning in&#160;2021, the precision of "at birth" was added to the sex question on the <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/98-304/2021001/chap5-eng.cfm">census questionnaire</a>, and a new question on gender was included. As a result, the historical continuity of information on sex was maintained while allowing all cisgender, transgender and non-binary individuals to report their gender. This addressed an important information gap on gender diversity (see <a href="/en/catalogue/982000012021001"><em>Filling the gaps: Information on gender in the&#160;2021&#160;Census</em></a> and <em><a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/sc/video/2021-census-gender-and-sex">2021&#160;Census: Sex at birth and gende<span class="nowrap">r&#8212;t</span>he whole picture</a></em>).</p><p>For many people, their <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Var.pl?Function=DEC&amp;Id=410445">gender</a> corresponds to their <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Var.pl?Function=DECI&amp;Id=1326694">sex at birth</a> (<a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&amp;TVD=1326715&amp;CVD=1326721&amp;CPV=11&amp;CST=01102021&amp;CLV=2&amp;MLV=2">cisgender men</a> and <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&amp;TVD=1326715&amp;CVD=1326721&amp;CPV=12&amp;CST=01102021&amp;CLV=2&amp;MLV=2">cisgender women</a>).

Statistics Canada always protects privacy and confidentiality of respondents when disseminating detailed data.</p><p>These modifications reflect today's reality in terms of the evolving acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual diversity and an emerging social and legislative recognition of transgender, non-binary and <a class="acro01-tooltip">LGBTQ2+</a> people in general, that is, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, or who use other terms related to gender or sexual diversity. In&#160;2017, the Canadian government amended the <em>Canadian Human Rights Act</em> and the Canadian <em>Criminal Code</em> to protect individuals from discrimination and hate crimes based on gender identity and expression.</p><p>These data can be used by public decision makers, employers, and providers of health care, education, justice, and other services to better meet the needs of all men and wome<span class="nowrap">n&#8212;i</span>ncluding transgender men and wome<span class="nowrap">n&#8212;a</span>nd non-binary people in their communities. </p><div id="jointrel" class="sd-jointrel"><h2>Highlights</h2><p>The&#160;2021&#160;Census of Population included for the first time a question on gender and the precision of "at birth" on the sex question, allowing all cisgender, transgender and non-binary individuals to report their gender.</p><p>Canada is the first country to collect and publish data on gender diversity from a national census.</p><p>Of the nearly&#160;30.5&#160;million people in Canada aged&#160;15&#160;and older living in a private household in May&#160;2021,&#160;100,815&#160;were transgender (59,460) or non-binary (41,355), accounting for&#160;0.33% of the population in this age group. </p><p>The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were three to seven times higher for Generation Z (born between&#160;1997&#160;and&#160;2006,&#160;0.79%) and millennials (born between&#160;1981&#160;and&#160;1996,&#160;0.51%) than for Generation X (born between&#160;1966&#160;and&#160;1980,&#160;0.19%), baby boomers (born between&#160;1946&#160;and&#160;1965,&#160;0.15%) and the Interwar and Greatest Generations (born in&#160;1945&#160;or earlier,&#160;0.12%).</p><p>Over time, the acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual diversity has evolved.

<p>Over time, the acceptance and understanding of gender and sexual diversity has evolved. Further, there has been social and legislative recognition of transgender, non-binary and <a class="acro03-tooltip">LGBTQ2+</a> people in general. Younger generations may be more comfortable reporting their gender identity than older generations.</p><p>The Canadian population aged&#160;15&#160;and older can be divided into six generations, each born in a different period. The following generations (and their age groups in May&#160;2021) are based on work from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/">Pew Research Center</a> and existing literature, and are consistent with the <em>Census in Brief: </em><a href="/en/catalogue/98-200-X2021003"><em>A generational portrait of Canada's aging population from the&#160;2021&#160;Census</em></a><em>:</em></p><p>Greatest Generation: people aged&#160;94&#160;or older (born before&#160;1928)</p><p>Interwar Generation: people aged&#160;76&#160;to&#160;93&#160;(born between&#160;1928&#160;and&#160;1945)</p><p>Baby boomers: people aged&#160;56&#160;to&#160;75&#160;(born between&#160;1946&#160;and&#160;1965)</p><p>Generation X: people aged&#160;41&#160;to&#160;55&#160;(born between&#160;1966&#160;and&#160;1980)</p><p>Generation Y (millennials): people aged&#160;25&#160;to&#160;40&#160;(born between&#160;1981&#160;and&#160;1996)</p><p>Generation Z: people aged&#160;15&#160;to&#160;24&#160;(born between&#160;1997&#160;and&#160;2006)</p><p>Younger generations had larger shares of those who were transgender or non-binary. The proportions of transgender and non-binary people were three to seven times higher for Generation Z (0.79%) and millennials (0.51%) than for Generation X (0.19%), baby boomers (0.15%) and the Interwar and Greatest Generations (0.12%).</p><p>Each generation holds attitudes and demonstrates behaviours informed by the historical context in which its members were raised.

The updated standards were published in October&#160;2021, and a "What we heard" report summarizing comments received during the public consultation will be published in the coming months.</p><p>The sex at birth standard provides a <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&amp;TVD=1326701">classification variant</a> with three categories (male, female and intersex). However, for reasons related to the small size of the intersex population and the challenges in identifying intersex people, Statistics Canada does not currently collect specific information on intersex people in Canada.</p><p>Tables&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2&#160;present distributions of the Canadian population aged&#160;15&#160;and older living in a private household by sex according to data from the&#160;1991&#160;to&#160;2016&#160;censuses and sex at birth and gender using&#160;2021&#160;Census data.</p><p>In&#160;2021, the number of people whose sex was male was very similar to the number of men. The same was observed among people whose sex was female compared with women. These similarities can be explained by the relatively small size of the transgender and non-binary populations. Moreover, the distribution of the population aged&#160;15&#160;and older in private households by sex (from&#160;1991&#160;to&#160;2016) and sex at birth (in&#160;2021) was very similar between census years.</p><p>In this article, certain gender non-binary terms were grouped based on their similarities (e.g., "genderqueer," "queer man" and "queer woman" are all included in the estimate of "queer"). For more information on collection and processing methods of responses to the "specify" option for the gender question, please refer to the <a href="/en/catalogue/98-500-X2021014">Age, Sex at Birth and Gender Reference Guide, Census of Population,&#160;2021</a><em></em>.</p><p>The term "Two-Spirit" is specific to some Indigenous peoples of North America (see <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&amp;TVD=1326727&amp;CVD=1326727&amp;CLV=0&amp;MLV=1&amp;D=1">gender classification</a>). However, the Indigenous identity of individuals was not taken into account when coding answers to the "specify" option for the gender question. The number of "Two-Spirit" answers may be smaller if only Indigenous individuals were included.</p><p>The definitions for terms describing non-binary gender are included in the <em><a href="https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/publications/diversite-diversity-eng.html">Gender and Sexual Diversity Glossary</a></em>, published by the Translation Bureau.</p><p>In this release, the analysis of gender diversity results is limited to the population aged&#160;15&#160;and older even though the question was asked regardless of age, as children aged&#160;14&#160;and younger may not be fully aware of their gender identity or may not have defined it yet.</p><p>In the <em>Census in brief: </em><a href="/en/catalogue/98-200-X2021003"><em>A generational portrait of Canada's aging population from the&#160;2021&#160;Census</em></a>, Generation Z is defined as people born between&#160;1997&#160;and&#160;2012&#160;and aged&#160;9&#160;to&#160;24&#160;in May&#160;2021. In this article, since the analysis is focused on the population aged&#160;15&#160;and older, Generation Z is redefined as those born between&#160;1997&#160;and&#160;2006&#160;and aged&#160;15&#160;to&#160;24&#160;in May&#160;2021.</p><p>To ensure the confidentiality of responses collected for the&#160;2021&#160;Census, a random rounding process is used to alter the values of released data. As a result, when these data are summed or grouped, the total value may not match the sum of the individual values, since the total and subtotals are independently rounded. Similarly, percentage distributions, which are calculated on rounded data, may not necessarily add up to&#160;100%.</p><h3>2021&#160;Census of Population products and releases</h3><p>Today, Statistics Canada is releasing the second set of results from the&#160;2021&#160;Census of Population.</p><p>Several&#160;2021&#160;Census products are also available today on the&#160;2021&#160;<a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm">Census Program</a> web module.
